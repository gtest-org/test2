2014-01-10T00:21:46  <bknudson> is "No distributions at all found for netifaces>=0.5" ? I was having this problem a few days ago with netaddr.
2014-01-10T00:21:57  <bknudson> is ... a known problem
2014-01-10T00:22:11  <bknudson> I'm running into it with keystone now, but gate doesn't seem to have it.
2014-01-10T00:22:20  <bknudson> doesn't seem to have a problem with it
2014-01-10T00:24:21  <foobio> bknudson: i have patches up to fix that in swift... don't recall if they've merged yet
2014-01-10T00:24:51  <bknudson> foobio: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/65023/ is merged in swift
2014-01-10T00:24:54  <foobio> though i guess my patches just fix it for running tests under tox

2014-01-10T00:25:31  <bknudson> is the gate using older virtualenv or whatever the prob was?
2014-01-10T00:25:58  <foobio> bknudson: yes, we have the gate set to use virtualenv 1.10.1 which bundles pip 1.4.1
2014-01-10T00:26:06  <bknudson> ok, that makes sense.
2014-01-10T00:26:12  <bknudson> thanks!
2014-01-10T00:26:19  <foobio> bknudson: what you're seeing crops up with virtualenv 1.11 which bundles pip 1.5
2014-01-10T00:26:28  <foobio> bknudson: the *fix* for that is to badger the netifaces devs to start uploading releases to pypi
2014-01-10T00:26:55  <foobio> (or, more work probably, to stop using netifaces and replace it with something else)
2014-01-10T00:27:15  <bknudson> I don't know how keystone picked this up.
2014-01-10T00:27:23  <bknudson> picked up the requirement on netifaces
2014-01-10T00:27:51  <bknudson> ok, test-requirements.txt has it.
2014-01-10T00:27:55  <foobio> bknudson: i saw someone updated the shared bug and etherpad with a note about proposed patches to keystone for it
2014-01-10T00:28:13  <foobio> there may already be an outstanding change which wants your review ;)

2014-01-10T00:31:46  <morganfainberg> might be safe to remove it?

2014-01-10T05:36:46  <devananda> jeblair: re: ironic check/gate patch, can we enable it (move it out of experimental pipe) in a non-voting way, ,in all three projects?
2014-01-10T05:37:18  <devananda> jeblair: my concern is if we only add it to ironic gate, then ironic's gate may be unknowingly broken bychanges in devstack or tempest
2014-01-10T05:38:20  <jeblair> devananda: right, but then if keystone breaks ironic, tempest can't merge patches
2014-01-10T05:38:22  <devananda> and we'll have no way to unblock our own gate
2014-01-10T05:39:25  <jeblair> devananda: yes, you'd have to propose a change to tempest or devstack in that case
2014-01-10T05:40:07  <devananda> jeblair: it seems like a terrible idea for this to remain in experimental pipie for devstack/tempest but be gating for ironic
2014-01-10T05:40:15  <devananda> devs in those projects wouldn't know when they break us

2014-01-10T10:35:15  <SergeyLukjanov> or probably ask someone to approve it again, AFAIK it should help too

2014-01-10T14:04:51  <foobio> kruskakli: anyway, your options are to use pip 1.4.1 instead of 1.5 (which probably means using virtualenv 1.10.1 instead of 1.11), or adjust tox.ini to pass --allow-external psutil --allow-insecure psutil to the pip install command. bug is https://launchpad.net/bugs/1267364

2014-01-10T14:05:22  <hashar> SergeyLukjanov: also commented out an idea which would be to detect the Zuul layout.yaml  is in a git repository and thus get the git sha1 from there.
2014-01-10T14:05:33  <hashar> but that is a different feature

2014-01-10T14:06:38  <SergeyLukjanov> hashar, it's not really helpful due to the fact that in infra layout.yaml file is installed by puppet AFAIK and isn't in the repo I think
2014-01-10T14:07:06  <SergeyLukjanov> hashar, but probably we could add some git/puppet magic to store sha to the file
2014-01-10T14:07:23  <hashar> SergeyLukjanov: on my install the layout is in a git repository which is then used to deploy.
2014-01-10T14:07:58  <SergeyLukjanov> hashar, oh, cool, then I'll try to make such patch too
2014-01-10T14:08:28  <SergeyLukjanov> hashar, I'm only able to read puppet scripts, no good exp on running them

2014-01-10T14:20:21  <BobBall> the other person who might be able to help is anthonym (Ant Messerli)
2014-01-10T14:20:43  <BobBall> thanks ruhe
2014-01-10T14:21:02  <BobBall> sorry! antonym... Erroneous h there.
2014-01-10T14:21:34  <SergeyLukjanov> BobBall, nodepool will work only with nova-net out of the box
2014-01-10T14:22:15  <anteaya> foobio: perhaps the weekend is a good time for 64786
2014-01-10T14:22:49  <foobio> BobBall: looking in the nodepool source, we seem to have the beginnings of fakes in the tools dir, but tox isn't configured for running any unit tests and i don't see any written yet

2014-01-10T14:29:02  <anteaya> kruskakli: let's start with you offering logs as a patch for a week
2014-01-10T14:29:17  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, does you mean bug about slave agent failures?
2014-01-10T14:29:26  <anteaya> that enables people to review your logs and offer your comments for improvement
2014-01-10T14:29:27  <kruskakli> anteaya: ?
2014-01-10T14:29:34  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, and I don't think that cores could reverify no bug (https://github.com/openstack-infra/config/blob/master/modules/openstack_project/files/zuul/layout.yaml#L34)
2014-01-10T14:29:50  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, only be resending approve as foobio mentioned before
2014-01-10T14:29:52  <anteaya> kruskakli: you have to prove your system is stable and that you can offer logs for developers
2014-01-10T14:30:22  <kruskakli> anteaya: but if it's not doing any voting, does it matter?
2014-01-10T14:30:38  <anteaya> SergeyLukjanov: my biggest concern is the suggestion that people game the syntax

2014-01-10T14:33:40  <anteaya> SergeyLukjanov: you suggested EmilienM do recheck bug 1 for his patch

2014-01-10T14:36:09  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, sure
2014-01-10T14:36:10  <anteaya> SergeyLukjanov: the correct way, if core on the project, is reverify no bug
2014-01-10T14:36:11  <openstackgerrit> John Dickinson proposed a change to openstack-infra/config: start logging openstack-swift  https://review.openstack.org/65969
2014-01-10T14:36:30  <anteaya> SergeyLukjanov: if not core, to offer reverify bug <bug-number>
2014-01-10T14:36:31  <foobio> anteaya: no, reverify no bug hasn't worked for a couple months. we disabled that, remember?
2014-01-10T14:36:34  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, reverify no bug was removed
2014-01-10T14:36:51  <anteaya> foobio: I thought core could still use it
2014-01-10T14:36:58  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, the only way is to resend approve comment
2014-01-10T14:37:01  <anteaya> in the case of infra issues
2014-01-10T14:37:03  <foobio> anteaya: you (remove if necessary and re-)add your approval vote
2014-01-10T14:37:14  <anteaya> oh okay
2014-01-10T14:37:17  *** thuc has quit IRC
2014-01-10T14:37:22  <anteaya> so again, core can do this
2014-01-10T14:37:26  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, foobio, but on the other hand, it looks like reverify no bug :(
2014-01-10T14:37:53  <foobio> anteaya: and for infra issues, when the infra team is doing this en masse, we have a 'zuul enqueue' utility we can use to add changes directly to a pipeline
2014-01-10T14:37:54  <SergeyLukjanov> but little more uncomfortable
2014-01-10T14:38:15  <anteaya> kruskakli: how can you fully hope to understand what developers need from your system, if you have no perception of what a developer experiences?
2014-01-10T14:38:17  *** rossella_s has joined #openstack-infra
2014-01-10T14:38:38  <foobio> SergeyLukjanov: the big difference from the old "reverify no bug" is that it's now limited to core reviewers on projects, who are hopefully somewhat more accountable for and aware of the problem at hand
2014-01-10T14:39:03  <anteaya> foobio: so core can still use revierify no bug?
2014-01-10T14:39:14  <foobio> anteaya: no, i just got done explaining that
2014-01-10T14:39:23  <foobio> anteaya: core can use approval votes
2014-01-10T14:39:23  *** dpyzhov has quit IRC

2014-01-10T14:39:37  <SergeyLukjanov> foobio, oh, correct, it's in fact limited to the core now
2014-01-10T14:39:39  <SergeyLukjanov> and that's ok
2014-01-10T14:39:49  <foobio> anteaya: the "approved" column you see in the review screen
2014-01-10T14:39:55  *** yamahata has joined #openstack-infra
2014-01-10T14:40:08  <anteaya> right
2014-01-10T14:40:19  <anteaya> so non-core needs a bug number
2014-01-10T14:40:28  <anteaya> not a fake one
2014-01-10T14:41:08  <openstackgerrit> A change was merged to openstack-infra/jenkins-job-builder: Add support to specify GitLab version.  https://review.openstack.org/65745
2014-01-10T14:41:27  <foobio> anteaya: i was just pointing out that by removing zuul's match on the "reverify no bug" comment syntax, effectively the only ways to reenqueue a change are for a core reviewer to readd an approval vote, for a contributor to leave a "recheck bug xxxxx" comment (which i've also seen going horribly wrong lately, but that's another issue), or for an infra root admin to directly add the change to the gate
2014-01-10T14:43:27  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, the problem is that the fake one could be used ;)
2014-01-10T14:43:35  <foobio> ruhe: prioritized infra task backlog... https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ci/ (bugs tagged low-hanging-fruit are hopefully things which any contributor can pitch in on without needing root access to infra's servers)

2014-01-10T14:46:49  *** jroovers has quit IRC
2014-01-10T14:48:01  <anteaya> kruskakli: your use of 3rd party testing tools and others have alerted us to a big problem, you are creating feedback with no knowledge of how that feedback is used and consumed by the openstack developers
2014-01-10T14:48:01  <sdague> oh look, someone poorly configured zuul - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/63647/
2014-01-10T14:48:07  <anteaya> this is a big problem
2014-01-10T14:48:15  <foobio> kruskakli: i have to agree with anteaya... if a vendor's main contribution is to write a driver which supports their proprietary hardware/systems, that's somewhat anti-social in a free software project. gaining familiarity with the ongoing development of the project is encouraged for effective integration with the community
2014-01-10T14:48:26  *** gokrokve has joined #openstack-infra
2014-01-10T14:49:01  <anteaya> while not a requirement yet, we are heading in the direction of requiring two active contributores per 3rd party test system for voting to be enabled
2014-01-10T14:49:42  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, +1 for such requirement
2014-01-10T14:49:47  <anteaya> otherwise the messs you can make with your system because you don't know how the results are consumed are just too difficult for the workflow of the developers affected
2014-01-10T14:50:05  <foobio> it helps to have enough familiarity with openstack internals to be able to point out *why* a change is breaking your black box, and to suggest possible alternative solutions
2014-01-10T14:50:29  *** jorisroovers has quit IRC
2014-01-10T14:50:39  <foobio> and that is best accomplished through being an active contributor to the core components with which your device or software is interacting in openstack
2014-01-10T14:51:48  <kruskakli> anteaya: I'm sorry to hear that, I've been contributing to open source as long as the concept has existed, but always on a voluntary basis according to what effort I've been able to muster, I need to ponder over this...

2014-01-10T14:55:17  <anteaya> you need to understand what a disruption this is for our devs
2014-01-10T14:55:49  <foobio> it has placed a surprising additional amount of workload on the infra team and, to a great extent, other subprojects that we're trying to teach the third-party ci operators about the openstack development process and workflow, particularly challenging if they're not expecting to contribute directly to the internals of the project
2014-01-10T14:56:00  <anteaya> we have quite a few tests systems run by people with no appreciation of how their logs or lack of them are interupted development
2014-01-10T14:56:41  <kruskakli> ok, I'll bring it up with my bozz and we'll see how to proceed

2014-01-10T16:03:04  <SergeyLukjanov> sdague, I'll take a look on your change today, it looks very useful
2014-01-10T16:03:22  <sdague> yeh, then I stop having to do math to see how bad our queue is
2014-01-10T16:03:34  <sdague> and, right now, top of queue entered 15+ hrs ago
2014-01-10T16:03:45  <foobio> i love that we have so many people contributing usability improvements to the zuul status screen now. that tells me there are *tons* of people who find it useful already too
2014-01-10T16:05:17  <SergeyLukjanov> foobio, I'd like to rewrite the js code to the more readable/patchable style, but I'm afraid that my knowledge of js isn't good enough now
2014-01-10T16:05:18  <foobio> though the test nodes graph has me worried that we have a lot of our aggregate quota full of stale entries stuck in a building or deleting state... checking up on that now
2014-01-10T16:05:49  <foobio> SergeyLukjanov: nor mine either, but sounds like an excellent opportunity to get better at it ;)
2014-01-10T16:06:35  <SergeyLukjanov> foobio, I'll probable return back to this idea after a pack of minor improvements to the server side zuul
2014-01-10T16:10:36  <sdague> SergeyLukjanov: actually, look at  http://javascriptissexy.com/handlebars-js-tutorial-learn-everything-about-handlebars-js-javascript-templating/

2014-01-10T16:10:44  <sdague> I think that would go a huge way
2014-01-10T16:11:22  <SergeyLukjanov> sdague, I think that templating will not be enough to make it more readable

2014-01-10T16:11:53  <SergeyLukjanov> both of them supports templating
2014-01-10T16:12:16  <SergeyLukjanov> and will provide us with ability to not rewrite the whole html for all changes
2014-01-10T16:12:21  <SergeyLukjanov> only changed elements
2014-01-10T16:12:31  <SergeyLukjanov> AFAIR
2014-01-10T16:13:04  <sdague> SergeyLukjanov: yeh, that would be a far more extensive undertaking
2014-01-10T16:13:17  <sdague> I think you could get rid of a ton of debt just getting to templates
2014-01-10T16:13:33  <sdague> and then do a further conversion in the future
2014-01-10T16:13:40  <SergeyLukjanov> sdague, yup, that's not so destructive as a fully rewrite ;)
2014-01-10T16:13:57  <sdague> SergeyLukjanov: and could be done in bite sized chunks
2014-01-10T16:14:26  <sdague> honestly, if jeblair isn't against it, I was going to start trickling in templated stuff over time

2014-01-10T17:30:59  <foobio> as it was, i had to contribute patches upstream (which landed in 2.5) and backport them to 2.4 because the feature was still half-baked
2014-01-10T17:31:10  <sdake> recently I changed permissions on the #heat channel to add logging support for the channel, where are the irc logs stored?

2014-01-10T17:32:24  <foobio> zaro: the bugs i fixed were unrelated, the cla signing interface in 2.4 was simply broken when we started trying to use it
2014-01-10T17:32:42  *** markmcclain has joined #openstack-infra
2014-01-10T17:34:25  <foobio> zaro: specifically bugs with the non-group based self-verifying cla functionality. so it's possible gerrit devs might consider a broken feature to not have been an actual released feature, since you couldn't use it without patching and rebuilding gerrit
2014-01-10T17:34:56  <foobio> i think one of the bugs was there, and one of the bugs was actually related to the contact information form being broken/unusable instead
2014-01-10T17:35:03  <zaro> foobio: wow, seems like it would be difficult for me to repro on 2.4
2014-01-10T17:36:03  <zaro> foobio: and it might not even be a bug against upstream at all because we are upgrading from our forked gerrit.
2014-01-10T17:36:08  <foobio> it may not be worth our time to reproduce, since they fixed it in 2.5 but did not backport fixes to 2.4
2014-01-10T17:36:47  <foobio> zaro: well, it's a failure to support upgrading from a broken feature which nobody could have used without backporting the fixes themselves, as we did
2014-01-10T17:37:13  <foobio> gerrit fixed them upstream, but they fixed them in 2.5

2014-01-10T17:44:05  <zaro> foobio: do we have to automate the upgrade from openstack gerrit 2.4 to upstream gerrit 2.8?
2014-01-10T17:44:37  <foobio> zaro: as i said, the feature was broken in 2.4, and they opted not to support it, but rather replaced bits of it in 2.5. i think that's more or less the resolution
2014-01-10T17:45:22  <zaro> foobio: my thought was that we do manual upgrade from 2.4 to 2.8, then automated from 2.8 and beyond.  since 1st upgrade is such a big spread.
2014-01-10T17:45:28  <foobio> zaro: i'm still in favor of just working around it, so long as the situation's documented upstream for the benefit of others who may have also hacked the broken cla support in 2.4 into a working state and then later decide to upgrade

2014-01-10T17:47:39  *** harlowja_away is now known as harlowja
2014-01-10T17:47:41  <foobio> specifically that we hand-patched 2.4 with fixes backported from 2.5 to get it working
2014-01-10T17:48:47  <foobio> because it had been released in a broken state in 2.4
2014-01-10T17:50:23  <zaro> ok. i have a better picture of what happened now.  i'll update the bug to see if _david_ wants to pursue.  i'm thinking it's unlikely that he would.
2014-01-10T17:51:22  <foobio> right, he seemed to be pretty insistent that it should get fixed upstream if it's a bug, but in this case i think it's a design flaw which upstream knew about and decided not to fix back in 2.5
2014-01-10T17:52:07  <foobio> instead they redid how some of it worked, and seemed to have decided not to provide an upgrade path from the nonworking implementation in 2.4
2014-01-10T17:52:24  <foobio> which makes sense. it's a pragmatic choice
2014-01-10T17:53:20  <foobio> to have actually used it in 2.4 you would have had to be running a fork

2014-01-10T18:45:16  <foobio> also, nodepool is back up again
2014-01-10T18:45:30  <foobio> within the next 10 minutes we should have nodes running more tests
2014-01-10T18:45:44  <Ryan_Lane2> on a scale of 10 - not interested, if I added github support to zuul would my changes be accepted upstream?
2014-01-10T18:46:14  <foobio> Ryan_Lane2: curious what you mean by "support" (github triggers or some such?)
2014-01-10T18:46:43  <Ryan_Lane2> github triggers and reporting back into github
2014-01-10T18:46:57  <Ryan_Lane2> basically gating support for it.
2014-01-10T18:47:27  <foobio> Ryan_Lane2: i suspect it would need to come with a fake backend and a fair battery of tests since we'd not want to connect to github when running zuul unit tests
2014-01-10T18:47:35  <Ryan_Lane2> indeed
2014-01-10T18:47:37  <foobio> Ryan_Lane2: but i'll defer to jeblair on it
2014-01-10T18:48:07  <foobio> as to whether or not we'd accept patches for support in-tree
2014-01-10T18:48:13  *** DinaBelova has quit IRC
2014-01-10T18:48:26  <Ryan_Lane2> I'm not working somewhere not using gerrit, but am quickly approaching the limits of what I can do in jenkins
2014-01-10T18:48:35  <Ryan_Lane2> s/not/now/
2014-01-10T18:48:51  <foobio> seems like a reasonable request to me as long as we can be assured we don't break it and don't need to touch github ourselves, but i'd seek additional consensus when people aren't in post-lca travel
2014-01-10T18:49:22  <Ryan_Lane2> sounds good. it may be that I don't end up using zuul, but I wanted to check before I went down that rabbit hole
2014-01-10T18:49:33  <foobio> Ryan_Lane2: looked at turbo-hipster? (non-jenkins job runner written in python by some of our contributors)
2014-01-10T18:50:00  <zaro> foobio: about discussion yesterday regarding Change Owner owner_group_id is set to 0 in the gerrit DB..
2014-01-10T18:50:13  <foobio> zaro: yeah, did you ever get additional details on that?
2014-01-10T18:50:39  <zaro> foobio: did some testing and found out that gerrit 2.8 doesn't even have that column anymore.
2014-01-10T18:50:46  <foobio> zaro: i'm going to guess 0 means "no owner"
2014-01-10T18:50:51  <foobio> oh!
2014-01-10T18:51:00  <zaro> foobio: in fact for 2.9 they moved all users from the DB.
2014-01-10T18:51:01  <Ryan_Lane2> I think we're fine using jenkins, but wanted to handle gating better than jenkins itself can handle
2014-01-10T18:51:40  <zaro> foobio: So the migrated tables don't even get used anymore, i think everthing got moved from db to git repo.
2014-01-10T18:52:14  <foobio> zaro: any idea when they're targeting for a 2.9 release? it sounds like they're doing such heavy refactoring we might be better trying to work on an upgrade to 2.9 if it's soon, and save ourselves extra work
2014-01-10T18:52:17  <Ryan_Lane2> foobio: do you know if zuul could have a merge event in master trigger events in open change requests?
2014-01-10T18:52:46  <zaro> foobio: which means i don't have to patch that at all :)
2014-01-10T18:52:46  <foobio> Ryan_Lane2: i'd need to know what "trigger events in open change requests" meant in this case
2014-01-10T18:52:59  <foobio> zaro: heh
2014-01-10T18:53:20  <Ryan_Lane2> well, I'd like to do something like rebase and recheck open change requests, so they are always tested against master
2014-01-10T18:54:42  *** mfer has joined #openstack-infra
2014-01-10T18:55:27  <Ryan_Lane2> my goal is continuous deployment, where all change requests are fully tested against the master and are always ready to merge and deploy
2014-01-10T18:56:06  <foobio> Ryan_Lane2: jeblair was talking about possibly adding a timed trigger to retest open changes in zuul and report on them if they're stale
2014-01-10T18:56:19  <Ryan_Lane2> that would be awesome
2014-01-10T18:56:24  <foobio> basically as a low-priority pipeline
2014-01-10T18:56:39  <foobio> so it gets available workers if there's nothing else taht needs them
2014-01-10T18:57:09  <Ryan_Lane2> in my case I'd have it as a trigger that occurs on master merges and retests. I just need to add a trigger for that, I'd imagine?
2014-01-10T18:57:20  <foobio> Ryan_Lane2: if you're interested in supporting that (i know it was on sdague's wishlist too) you should talk to jeblair about implementation details
2014-01-10T18:57:49  *** dpyzhov has quit IRC
2014-01-10T18:57:57  <foobio> Ryan_Lane2: that sounds sane... if master moves and there are changes which are still open, retest and report
2014-01-10T18:58:09  <Ryan_Lane2> well, let me ensure I'm going to use this before I make any promises :)
2014-01-10T18:58:18  <foobio> maybe with a throttle so it won't do it unless it's been for a configurable period of time
2014-01-10T18:58:36  <Ryan_Lane2> yeah, that's a good idea
2014-01-10T18:58:52  <foobio> and maybe only have it leave a comment if it's failing
2014-01-10T18:59:06  <foobio> or rather, only comment if it would be a state/vote change
2014-01-10T18:59:27  * Ryan_Lane2 nods
2014-01-10T18:59:32  <foobio> to catch open changes which go from broken to working without a new patchset because master grew a feature they needed or something

2014-01-10T19:10:03  <foobio> flashgordon: spinning up new nodes takes on the order of 15 minutes, and it gets throttled a little so we don't invoke the wrath of our generous cloud providers
2014-01-10T19:10:07  <sdague> that will move the overall gate stats to a dedicated page

2014-01-10T19:12:27  <flashgordon> so whats the time in queue for gate?
2014-01-10T19:12:50  <foobio> flashgordon: changes get tested first-come-first-served, so a gate reset means that all the restacked changes in the gate pipeline get to wait their turn after changes which were already in the check pipeline waiting on nodes
2014-01-10T19:13:07  <flashgordon> foobio: O_o oh

2014-01-10T19:13:57  <flashgordon> actually scratch that
2014-01-10T19:14:00  <flashgordon> thats a can of worms
2014-01-10T19:14:09  <sdague> flashgordon: we did that once, then we starved out check
2014-01-10T19:14:12  *** ivar-lazzaro has joined #openstack-infra
2014-01-10T19:14:19  <foobio> flashgordon: we tried priorities, but it meant that when the gate got deep enough to use all available nodes, check pipeline changes sat indefinitely waiting for resources and devs never got any feedback
2014-01-10T19:14:19  <sdague> flashgordon: top of gate is 16hrs
2014-01-10T19:14:22  <flashgordon> sdague: yeah can o worms
2014-01-10T19:14:25  <flashgordon> sdague: 16 hours nice!
2014-01-10T19:14:46  <flashgordon> so the answer would be prioritize the top x in gate or something like that
2014-01-10T19:14:46  <openstackgerrit> Davanum Srinivas (dims) proposed a change to openstack-infra/devstack-gate: Capture libvirtd logs  https://review.openstack.org/65833
2014-01-10T19:15:00  <sdague> flashgordon: pull - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/65993/ and gvfs-open status.html
2014-01-10T19:15:03  <foobio> flashgordon: it might be possible to do a weighted distribution algorithm, like you said, instead of straight prioritization, but that would need new code in zuul
2014-01-10T19:15:31  <flashgordon> foobio: right, maybe just prioritize top 1 of gate

2014-01-10T20:44:08  <flashgordon> marun: correct file-based
2014-01-10T20:44:09  <marun> concurrency => synchronization

2014-01-10T20:53:04  <harlowja> ok, probably simple, so is it possible to get the colorized output via running python setup.py with a testr enabled project
2014-01-10T20:53:29  <harlowja> like python setup.py --verbose test --no-parallel doesn't seem to  do it

2014-01-10T20:53:44  <foobio> harlowja: i think nova has a color filter which you can feed the subunit stream through
2014-01-10T20:54:00  <harlowja> right, any idea if that can just be integrated into testr directly?

2014-01-10T20:54:57  <foobio> it's geared toward running all or specific sets of tests, evaluating the results, and then has a robust set of options to rerun tests based on the results of previous runs
2014-01-10T20:55:20  <foobio> so you can, for example, tell it to just re-run failing tests

2014-01-10T21:03:07  <foobio> sdague: well, both nova unit tests and tempest fail due to what seems like the new libvirt in uca

2014-01-10T21:03:21  <foobio> so either would be a good test
2014-01-10T21:03:24  <foobio> both would be better

2014-01-10T21:23:05  <foobio> it's probably been abandoned since november, don't exactly remember

2014-01-10T21:27:33  <foobio> arosen: looks like maybe pylint released a broken package?

2014-01-10T21:28:20  <arosen> yea, i saw that.. I guess the gate isn't hitting it because it hasn't pulled in the latest pylint and it's using a cached copy?
2014-01-10T21:29:01  *** SergeyLukjanov has quit IRC
2014-01-10T21:29:06  <foobio> quite possible--we may want to emergency cap it. looking to see if 0.25.0 is shiny-new

2014-01-10T21:29:43  <foobio> yeah, current pylint is weeks old 1.1.0
2014-01-10T21:30:16  <foobio> maybe a new release of something else specified a broken pylint as a requirement
2014-01-10T21:30:33  <foobio> oh

2014-01-10T21:32:00  <sdague> yep
2014-01-10T21:32:14  <foobio> arosen: try uninstalling your system package of pylint

2014-01-10T21:36:44  *** Ryan_Lane2 has left #openstack-infra
2014-01-10T21:38:29  <foobio> though i think the "package init file './test/__init__.py' not found (or not a regular file)" is probably the real problem
2014-01-10T21:38:34  <arosen> foobio:  yup same thing: http://codepad.org/Rsa0cWhw see line 1 shows i have no more pylint
2014-01-10T21:39:16  <foobio> oh, or maybe that's just a stray, benign message
2014-01-10T21:40:01  <arosen> foobio:  the problem is it causes testtools not to be installed.
2014-01-10T21:40:43  <foobio> it's complaining about syntax errors in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pylint/test/input/func_w0705.py which was not there before you started to install according to your find comment
2014-01-10T21:40:51  *** ryanpetrello has quit IRC
2014-01-10T21:41:06  <foobio> so either that file is from a corrupt archive, or your interpreter is wrong

2014-01-10T21:42:17  <foobio> when it's done it claims "Successfully installed pylint testrepository testtools" though
2014-01-10T21:42:58  <foobio> so maybe the syntax errors in the pylint test are really there upstream in that version, and they just get ignored (but complain loudly at you anyway)?
2014-01-10T21:45:53  <arosen> foobio:  thanks i fixed it. There was actually a bug in the code //usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pylint/test/input/func_w0705.py once i fixed the that it worked.... Very odd.
2014-01-10T21:46:09  <foobio> yeah, that's a little strange

2014-01-10T21:47:28  <foobio> maybe you want to check the tarball against the checksum on pypi to make sure it's not been deviled with
2014-01-10T21:49:02  <foobio> https://pypi.python.org/simple/pylint/ says pylint-0.25.2.tar.gz should have an md5sum of d878d7688a4f5290dc5b53a836872400
2014-01-10T21:49:25  <foobio> you should probably check your pip cache to see if you get the same
2014-01-10T21:50:08  * foobio gets weirdly paranoid about things like that
2014-01-10T21:51:48  *** vipuls is now known as vipuls-away
2014-01-10T21:51:56  <arosen> foobio: Hrm i'm not finding the pip cache where is that?
2014-01-10T21:53:44  <foobio> arosen: i'm guessing /root/.pip/cache/ but if you don't have one, then pip's probably not caching downloads
2014-01-10T21:54:19  <foobio> could also be some artifacts in /tmp/pip-build-root
2014-01-10T21:54:44  <arosen> root@arosen-desktop:~/.pip_download_cache# md5sum https%3A%2F%2Fpypi.python.org%2Fpackages%2Fsource%2Fp%2Fpylint%2Fpylint-0.25.2.tar.gz

2014-01-10T21:54:52  <arosen> Yea it matches the hash
2014-01-10T21:55:00  <foobio> aha. and okay, good
2014-01-10T21:55:30  <foobio> so it's probably just a bug in 0.25.2 which is spewing nonsense during install but gets ignored by pip
2014-01-10T21:55:49  <arosen> Had to remove it and set export PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE . Gets me into the same situation where i need to edit /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pylint/test/input/func_w0705.py
2014-01-10T21:55:55  <foobio> the errors all seemed to be in unit tests for pylint, not in actual run-time code
2014-01-10T21:56:37  <foobio> so i'm guessing pip is running the pylint's provided test suite, which is broken, but pip could care less anyway
2014-01-10T21:57:23  <foobio> or rather the setup.py for pylint is running the test suite, after being invoked by pip, but you get the idea
2014-01-10T21:57:56  <foobio> and setup.py probably spews test errors on stdout/stderr but still exits 0

2014-01-10T22:36:53  <sdague> flashgordon: +1 on bumping timeouts
2014-01-10T22:36:53  <flashgordon> it may be a decent short term solution
2014-01-10T22:37:04  <flashgordon> sdague: by how much 5 minutes?
2014-01-10T22:37:07  <sdague> remember though that you need to handle it in the inner script as well
2014-01-10T22:37:13  <sdague> if you are going to bump them, add 30 minutes
2014-01-10T22:37:15  * flashgordon looks at foobio
2014-01-10T22:37:59  <flashgordon> we should also look into getting these tests faster http://paste.openstack.org/raw/61010/
2014-01-10T22:38:20  <foobio> flashgordon: i can bump the timeout(s both places)
2014-01-10T22:38:41  <foobio> i'll set them to 95 outer, 90 inner i guess

2014-01-10T22:47:29  <sdague> that will let us really easily add more jobtypes
2014-01-10T22:48:03  <sdague> actually, it defaults to working on all the job types, we can add the readiness files to make them less likely to miss
2014-01-10T22:48:38  <foobio> okay, so bump postgres-full to 95(90) and... do we care about postgres (non-full) timeout?
2014-01-10T22:48:46  <sdague> I think it's functionally correct, but our unit tests are such a wreck that they require uber hackiness

2014-01-10T22:56:16  <foobio> complicity confirmed
2014-01-10T22:56:17  <pballand> foobio: that makes sense.  Any recommendations for a stackforge project that relies on a 3rd party package from a flaky server?  (is it acceptable to cache the package in the project?)
2014-01-10T22:56:25  <sdague> any chance the yaml values could be sent down automatically?

2014-01-10T23:01:22  <foobio> sdague: for bonus points, in devstack-gate we could find a way to check the job start time against when the timeout command gets invoked and take the difference into account, so we only need fudge time for file uploads at the end and and whatnot

2014-01-10T23:11:05  <pballand> foobio: okay, there are already concerns regarding the stability of that package - there is a history of introducing bugs in new versions, so perhaps caching the exact version of the code is the best way forward for now
