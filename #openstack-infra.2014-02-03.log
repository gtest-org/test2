2014-02-03T00:00:26  <anteaya> awesome
2014-02-03T00:00:28  <mattoliverau> anteaya: other then that, reading over a weekend+ of infra logs :)
2014-02-03T00:00:52  *** UtahDave has quit IRC
2014-02-03T00:00:55  <anteaya> looking forward to TH taking over the world
2014-02-03T00:01:02  <anteaya> yeah, happy reading
2014-02-03T00:01:21  <anteaya> mattoliverau: do you have a url for your TH puppetization patch yet?
2014-02-03T00:02:13  *** lttrl has quit IRC
2014-02-03T00:04:13  <anteaya> mattoliverau: you know that we don't fork as part of our workflow with gerrit, yeah?
2014-02-03T00:04:22  <anteaya> we just branch
2014-02-03T00:04:37  <mattoliverau> it's in my git hub atm.. so http://is.gd/FhoC7j Although I should move it over to rcbau (the teams github account).
2014-02-03T00:05:17  <mattoliverau> anteaya: it's actually a branch (I've just got it in my github so I can push the branch around to my dev PC and puppet master box)
2014-02-03T00:05:36  <mordred> or ... just submit it to openstack-infra/config as a patch ...
2014-02-03T00:05:44  * mordred goes back to sportsball
2014-02-03T00:06:00  <mattoliverau> mordred: I plan too.... once I've ironed out the bugs :)
2014-02-03T00:06:57  <anteaya> mattoliverau: the main thing is that the parent refs need to be something gerrit knows about, in order for it to be mergable
2014-02-03T00:08:19  <mattoliverau> The repo is tracking your upstream repo. So the refs should all be good :)
2014-02-03T00:09:54  <anteaya> okay
2014-02-03T00:09:57  <mordred> bugs, schmugs
2014-02-03T00:10:15  <anteaya> yeah, I'm with mordred, I'd like to see it as a patch on gerrit
2014-02-03T00:10:22  <anteaya> you can mark it WIP if you like
2014-02-03T00:12:25  <anteaya> nice

2014-02-03T09:41:22  <alevine> Hi everybody, I've got problems running jenkins for python26 and python27 jobs. It fails with "error: option --slowest not recognized". I'm wondering if it's the same problem as in https://bugs.launchpad.net/subunit/+bug/1274056 which is apparently fixed. Anybody can help with this?
2014-02-03T09:43:03  <alevine> This is happening in review https://review.openstack.org/#/c/70528/ which is initial code commit for gce-api service.

2014-02-03T14:25:00  <foobio> the real question is whether we're back in the same network as the openstack meetbot (we seem to be). wonder what it saw in the alternate dimension it was visiting
2014-02-03T14:26:10  <foobio> nothing of consequence according to eavesdrop.o.o

2014-02-03T14:36:27  <reed> let me know if you know, I'd like to test the actvity board for cases of a commit mentioning a bug report but with a failed href link in the review.o.o
2014-02-03T14:36:50  *** gokrokve has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-03T14:38:24  <foobio> reed: well, the process governing lp bug hyperlinks in the gerrit webui is not the same process which updates lp bugs based on the contents of a change's commit message. we try to make them as consistent as we can but they're completely separate (one is configurable rendering for the interface, the other is an event hook)
2014-02-03T14:39:06  <reed> oh, of course, got confused :)

2014-02-03T16:33:46  <foobio> the openstackgerrit gerritbot is another story however... it's continuing to fail on the nonetype object has no attribute "send" issue it usually encounters, but this time it seems to happen whether i hardcode an ipv4 address for irc.freenode.net in /etc/hosts or not... so i'm suspecting it's not going to be usable until the ddos subsides

2014-02-03T16:44:55  <foobio> mordred: i think pleia2 had an outstanding bug to puppet that
2014-02-03T16:45:09  <mordred> ok. so, somewhere there's just a magic key in a location on gerrit?
2014-02-03T16:45:30  <mordred> or is it something that we inject into gerrit in some insane way
2014-02-03T16:45:53  <foobio> if memory serves, it cropped up while those servers were being set up, so she opened a bug to puppet it and i added an entry for it in hiera

2014-02-03T17:17:02  <BobBall> foobio: nodepool removed loading host SSH keys (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/67738/) - I think this prevents you using provider.keypair, and also prevents you being able to log in from the nodepool host - is that correct?

2014-02-03T17:19:53  <foobio> BobBall: i don't think it would prevent either of those things... it's only intended to stop paramiko from caring whether it has seen an ssh host key before (since it tends to long into new nodes only once, and therefore can neither know that they're correct nor have any use for tracking them indefinitely)

2014-02-03T17:21:55  <BobBall> hmmm, then I'm very confused...
2014-02-03T17:22:35  <BobBall> How can we use provider.keypair then?  I don't see anywhere else where it can load keys from the system?
2014-02-03T17:22:45  <foobio> BobBall: basically the failure scenario this is solving is that previously nodepool would cache seen host keys for new slaves, then the next time that same ip address came up in rotation (reused by the provider) it would fail to connect because the new host key didn't match what it had on record for that ip address
2014-02-03T17:23:20  <foobio> BobBall: what does provider.keypair have to do with host keys?
2014-02-03T17:23:43  *** markwash has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-03T17:23:54  * foobio is confused. thought provider.keypair was a client key
2014-02-03T17:24:26  <BobBall> Well http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/nodepool/tree/nodepool/nodepool.py#n440 lets you specify the provider.keypair as the one to use when launching / setting up the image

2014-02-03T17:26:03  *** markwash has quit IRC
2014-02-03T17:26:37  <BobBall> We've been using it to allow login from the nodepool host to the VMs that we're booting in RAX.  However, if I specify keypair with lifeless' patch enabled, you can't login to the host because parmiko hasn't loaded the key.  It works without the patch of course.

2014-02-03T17:29:11  <foobio> BobBall: interesting dilemma... so it looks like the provider.keypair option was brought in by http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/nodepool/commit/?id=a0eac8a4

2014-02-03T17:32:47  <BobBall> I think it's a little different, but yes.  I don't think we're using puppet at all - but we want to use nodepool to set up the nodes
2014-02-03T17:33:07  <BobBall> We had a global keypair that we added and wanted all VMs to use that keypair
2014-02-03T17:33:35  <foobio> does paramiko emit any sort of exception trying to do that once it's lo longer loading the system host keys list?

2014-02-03T17:37:01  <foobio> i suspect we might be able to overcome that by telling paramiko to only load the global host keys file and not the nodepool user's locakl one

2014-02-03T17:40:03  <foobio> BobBall: at least for our use case, nodepool logs into the template vm and applies a puppet manifest which sets up authorized keys files for the accounts which we need to be able to log in. then when it snapshots that to launch new vms from it they're already configured to allow those keys
2014-02-03T17:40:08  *** vipul has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-03T17:40:31  <BobBall> If so, what is image.private_key for?  That's set in openstack's config, right?
2014-02-03T17:41:12  *** atiwari has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-03T17:41:20  <foobio> BobBall: that's the key the nodepool account uses to log into the template vm when setting up the initial image
2014-02-03T17:42:37  <foobio> the puppet thing was just a convenient solution since we already apply puppet to our long-running servers to add our accounts as authorized to ssh into them
2014-02-03T17:43:15  <foobio> you could presumably use any mechanism you like to set up the authorized keys in the appropriate accounts on your template vm while the image is being set up
2014-02-03T17:44:07  <BobBall> Sorry, I'm still confused... is the following right?  1) Create a new keypair.  2) Creating the base image using that keypair. 3) use puppet to push down new keys.  4) snapshot base image.  5) use private_key as the key to log in to the server?
2014-02-03T17:45:11  * foobio needs to read back through the code... just a minute
2014-02-03T17:45:48  <BobBall> Sorry about this... We've got to do some very ugly things when getting xenserver working in RAX and tying the two together is more fun than I could ever wish for

2014-02-03T17:51:09  <foobio> BobBall: okay, yes, i was slightly wrong earlier. the private-key option in our nodepool.yaml points to the local path on the nodepool server for a private key which corresponds to the jenkins_ssh_private_key_contents hiera data in our global puppet site manifest. the corresponding public key for that is being installed by puppet onto the template as allowed for the jenkins user to ssh into
2014-02-03T17:51:11  <foobio> individual nodepool nodes
2014-02-03T17:51:42  <foobio> and yes, the puppetry is being applied in the template vm (to create the image) via those prep scripts
2014-02-03T17:52:12  * BobBall starts nodding as if he's slowing understanding
2014-02-03T17:52:19  <foobio> i was mistaken about the initial login to the template vm from the nodepool server as root though... it must be using a keypair generated via novaclient

2014-02-03T17:53:30  *** rakhmerov has quit IRC
2014-02-03T17:53:46  <BobBall> OK - so what I was trying to do was get the template set up with the same key as private-key, rather than have a random temporary keypair
2014-02-03T17:54:14  *** thuc has quit IRC
2014-02-03T17:54:23  <superbee> foobio: second round of dentisting happens today so I will be useless for a good chunk of today (also isn't this an unofficial holiday or something?)
2014-02-03T17:54:27  <BobBall> Maybe I should check image.private_key and get paramiko to load that, then provider.keypair would work (although perhaps it should be image.keypair)
2014-02-03T17:54:46  *** thuc has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-03T17:54:49  <BobBall> You know - what I'll do is if image.private_key is set then I'll use that as the base for the keypair generated
2014-02-03T17:54:52  <BobBall> that'll fix all my provlems!
2014-02-03T17:54:55  <BobBall> problems*
2014-02-03T17:55:00  <foobio> BobBall: yeah, i think we might like to do that too eventually, mainly because node launches can leave keypair cruft on the provider when they fail in certain ways, and those pile up until we hit our keypair quota and start getting denied new servers
2014-02-03T17:55:05  <BobBall> unless that's not what you want
2014-02-03T17:55:19  <BobBall> What's the benefit of each image having a new keypair?
2014-02-03T17:55:43  <BobBall> pre-puppet application of course, so it's just the image rather than the VM
2014-02-03T17:55:46  <foobio> BobBall: i think it was novaclient's default behavior? not positive
2014-02-03T17:56:10  <BobBall> OK.  I'll work on a patch tomorrow and hopefully that'll get some interesting discussions going.

2014-02-03T17:58:25  <foobio> mmm, maybe it was an attempt to be more stateless... i see we have an explicit addKeypair() method which calls paramiko.RSAKey.generate()
2014-02-03T17:58:50  <BobBall> I'll update that to allow passing a parameter which will then use RSAKey.from_private_key_file

2014-02-03T17:59:32  <BobBall> Maybe.
2014-02-03T17:59:37  <BobBall> I'll have a think about it tomorrow.
2014-02-03T17:59:42  <BobBall> Thanks for the explanation.
2014-02-03T17:59:50  <foobio> aha, it only calls that if the provider has the "os-keypairs" extension
2014-02-03T18:00:22  <BobBall> Yes - but I suspect that if you _don't_ have that extension, the provider.keypair is currently broken (since no key is loaded from the host)
2014-02-03T18:00:34  <foobio> entirely probable, yes
2014-02-03T18:01:04  <BobBall> Maybe I'll add a provider.private_key which is required if provider.keypair is set - and then load that using paramiko... I think that's the easiest fix without breaking the host keys
2014-02-03T18:01:05  * foobio makes a note to get more familiar with nodepool's current keypair handling workflow
2014-02-03T18:02:16  <BobBall> Actually, provider.keypair doesn't make sense in this context - it really has to be image.keypair, coupled with image.private_key
2014-02-03T18:02:41  <BobBall> Anyway - time for me to head off.
2014-02-03T18:03:05  <foobio> BobBall: but yes, nodepool and its prep scripts got generalized out of prior work in devstack-gate, which traditionally relied heavily on puppet to do anything puppet could do on the template system/image. i don't think we'd be against things which made puppet less mandatory for the bootstrap phase, but i'll let the other reviewers speak for themselves

2014-02-03T18:37:02  <foobio> lifeless: but what BobBallAway was suggesting is that for some reason when he sets a provider key it used to work, but that one change (to stop paramiko loading system host keys) also seems to cause it to fail to use the static provider key claiming an authentication error. sounds like maybe some unexpected side effect within paramiko
2014-02-03T18:38:49  <lifeless> foobio: I very much doubt that, having read through the code

2014-02-03T19:14:18  <Sukhdev> Folks have a quick question - can I filter the tests list to "tox -esmoke-serial"? Some of the tests are troublesome on my setup and want to include them from the list. Any pointers?
2014-02-03T19:15:35  *** sarob has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-03T19:16:29  <superbee> Sukhdev: is this for tempest? if so no because smoke-serial already applies a filter. You can apply a filter to -efull though
2014-02-03T19:17:40  <mrmartin> foobio: you have the point, this yaml file indentation was the problem.
2014-02-03T19:17:55  <Sukhdev> superbee: yes, this is for tempest testing. Yes -esmoke-serial picks all smoke tests - I want to exclude some of the tests
2014-02-03T19:18:06  <foobio> mrmartin: great! glad it worked out
2014-02-03T19:18:22  <mrmartin> foobio: please review the patch now, it could be great to see how that works in the real world. https://review.openstack.org/#/c/68912/

2014-02-03T19:19:52  <superbee> Sukhdev: I know. Basaically there is already a filter on smoke-serial and you can't 'and' in another filter. You can however apply a filter to the full test listing

2014-02-03T19:20:22  *** harlowja has quit IRC
2014-02-03T19:20:55  <foobio> superbee: i rebased that stack of nodepool delete improvements to address a couple of very easy comments in the bottom-most two not-yet-approved patches. should be a quick re-review on any where trivial-rebase didn't kick in. we could probably merge those today and knock out a fairly large chunk of reviews in one fell swoop
2014-02-03T19:21:38  <superbee> foobio: cool. I will be AFK in about an hour to do second round of dentisting. I will try to rereview between now and then
2014-02-03T19:22:15  <foobio> superbee: okay, no rush. good luck with teeth and whatnot
2014-02-03T19:22:32  <superbee> thanks. I will be all done after today
2014-02-03T19:24:31  <Sukhdev> superbee: Presently, I get the list of all tests by running testr list-tests and then filter the list and run "testr run -load-list=<list>" to run the tests - wanted to see if I could do something similar with tox command
2014-02-03T19:25:53  *** harlowja has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-03T19:25:54  <superbee> Sukhdev: you can just pass a regex filter through tox to testr. eg tox -efull -- someregexhere

2014-02-03T19:26:02  *** mfer has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-03T19:26:06  <superbee> you can't do that with tox -esmoke-serial because it already applies a regex iirc
2014-02-03T19:28:47  <Sukhdev> superbee: in that case, is there a way to generate a detailed output of the tests from "testr run" command - when I run it, it either puts out 325 test ran successfully - or prints the failures. It does not list which tests ran successfully - perhaps I am missing some setting?

2014-02-03T19:31:00  <superbee> Sukhdev: and its silence indicates all tests ran successfully

2014-02-03T20:43:31  <Ajaeger1> Hi infra team, I have a problem with our docu gate.
2014-02-03T20:43:48  <Ajaeger1> http://logs.openstack.org/34/70834/1/check/gate-openstack-manuals-tox-checksyntax/7eee9d1/console.html shows a failure of a patch for stable/havana.
2014-02-03T20:44:06  <Ajaeger1> This is the first time I see this - the gating works just fine on trunk.

2014-02-03T20:52:04  <foobio> hashar: i have not done it personally, but apparently you can run a tripleo "undercloud" on a single machine (say a laptop) hosting the various control-plane services which see the bare metal servers as managed instances, and then you can use it to make other openstack clouds on groups of those bare metal instances
2014-02-03T20:52:41  <foobio> or presumably do other things with the bare metal instances at that point i guess

2014-02-03T23:41:06  <foobio> superbee: i think deletes are working okay. i'm keeping an eye on a couple of nodes which were in a delete state before the restart to see what happens with them
2014-02-03T23:41:10  <superbee> zaro: reviewed
2014-02-03T23:42:20  <mtreinish> jog0: I'm trying to understand what you plan to implement. You want the large ops scenario to skip if cinder or horizon is enabled?
2014-02-03T23:42:25  *** markwash has quit IRC
2014-02-03T23:42:36  <foobio> superbee: so far all delete state nodes are newer than 0.1 hours in that state, with the exception 5: 2.87, 23.15, 23.40, 283.28, 283.43
2014-02-03T23:42:57  <superbee> I tried killing the 283.* nodes over the weekend, they would not budge
2014-02-03T23:43:11  <foobio> those last two i believe are hung in delete on the provider end and would need to be removed from the nodepool db manually and a ticket opened with the provider

2014-02-03T23:43:55  <jog0> mtreinish: no, I want to set up the large-ops test to not run cinder or horizon (as they aren't tested in it anyway) and that would automatically mean the alrge-ops job won't run on horizon aor cinder patches
2014-02-03T23:44:18  <foobio> i'm going to relocate to a more comfortable computing location which has nachos. brb
2014-02-03T23:45:07  <mtreinish> jog0: wouldn't that just be a devstack gate thing?
2014-02-03T23:45:50  <jog0> mtreinish: yeah

2014-02-03T23:46:53  <mtreinish> jog0: oh ok, that's where I was confused. I was trying to figure out if you were intending to make a tempest change to do something
2014-02-03T23:47:13  <mtreinish> jog0: ok that's fair but infra (and sdague) are the only cores on devstack-gate :)

2014-02-03T23:47:24  <mtreinish> and I don't think we have a lp for it either
2014-02-03T23:47:36  <wenlock> hey superbee we were trouble shooting an issue we ran into with puppet:///modules/zuul/zuul.init
2014-02-03T23:47:47  <wenlock> superbee, do you know if that init script is good?
2014-02-03T23:48:01  <superbee> wenlock: yes it should be good, we use it
2014-02-03T23:48:17  <jog0> mtreinish: yo udo now https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-qa/+spec/auto-generate-gate-jobs
2014-02-03T23:48:30  <superbee> wenlock: note that if you don't use the stop command you may not have cleaned up the /var/run/zuul dir which would prevent zuul from starting later
2014-02-03T23:48:37  <wenlock> superbee, yeah on our side it won't start the service, so we have to run /etc/init.d/zuul start directly instead of using service zuul start
2014-02-03T23:48:56  <superbee> oh I don't use service *
2014-02-03T23:49:07  <mtreinish> jog0: heh, I didn't even know about that lp project
2014-02-03T23:49:14  <wenlock> superbee, ahhh ok... so thats why it's not managed as a service resource in puppet

2014-02-03T23:49:29  <superbee> wenlock: no, that isn't why.
2014-02-03T23:49:44  <superbee> it isn't managed as a service in puppet because jbooboo dislikes puppet managing services
2014-02-03T23:50:07  <wenlock> superbee, haha,..... but it doesn't even work with service zuul start | stop , etc
2014-02-03T23:50:17  <superbee> at all?
2014-02-03T23:50:20  <wenlock> nope

2014-02-03T23:51:14  <superbee> am I a weirdo for invoking init scripts directly?
2014-02-03T23:51:35  <wenlock> superbee.... thats ok for dev purposes.... not so good for produciton
2014-02-03T23:51:55  <wenlock> superbee especially if you want to count on the os restarting it at reboot

2014-02-03T23:52:06  <superbee> wenlock: why?
2014-02-03T23:52:29  <mordred> well...I think there are two interactions here ...
2014-02-03T23:52:48  <mordred> beacuse jbooboo does not like puppet starting and stopping services for us, we do not mark things as services
2014-02-03T23:52:53  <mtreinish> jog0: honestly we probably should delete that lp and make a devstack gate one
2014-02-03T23:52:59  <mtreinish> I'll do that tomorrow
2014-02-03T23:53:05  <mordred> that leads to puppet not doing anything like update-rc.d after copying in the init script
2014-02-03T23:53:28  <superbee> mordred: wenlock: you can have a service enabled but leave off the running
2014-02-03T23:53:29  <mordred> which means that I would expect no symlinks in rc.d or whatnot
2014-02-03T23:53:41  <superbee> but this has nothing to do with `service` aiui

2014-02-03T23:54:15  <foobio> well, the service command may look for symlinks matching your current runlevel
2014-02-03T23:54:24  <foobio> depending on the distro

2014-02-03T23:55:56  <superbee> anyways it should be fixed, I just invoke what I mean :)
2014-02-03T23:56:09  <foobio> service was a long-time redhatism. i think starting with red hat linux 5 or 6... but yeah i tend to only use it on red hat's distros
2014-02-03T23:56:25  <miqui> agreed with foobio
2014-02-03T23:56:32  <superbee> foobio: runlevels are dead on ubuntu for the most part. upstart doesn't really care about single user or multiuser or anything fun
2014-02-03T23:56:39  <foobio> (and i tend not to use red hats distros when i have an alternative choice)
