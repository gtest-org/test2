2014-04-01T00:00:28  <clarkb> nodepool graceful shutdown can be slow... going to give it a bit longer before I take a bigger hammer to it
2014-04-01T00:01:55  <kiall> clarkb, no worries - openstack-infra downtime is the OpenStack equivalent of http://xkcd.com/303/ ;)

2014-04-01T00:17:34  <asselin> for the provider node
2014-04-01T00:20:25  <clarkb> asselin: simplest thing is probably to have the image build script set it for you
2014-04-01T00:21:36  <asselin> clarkb, yes, I did that and it works until it gets to here, when the env vars seem to get lost in the new bash session. wget https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/config/plain/install_puppet.sh
2014-04-01T00:21:36  <asselin> sudo bash -xe install_puppet.sh

2014-04-01T00:22:22  <asselin> export http_proxy="..."
2014-04-01T00:22:31  <asselin> just a few lines above in the script
2014-04-01T00:22:51  <asselin> and export https_proxy
2014-04-01T00:23:03  <clarkb> asselin: is that in the script that calls install_puppet.sh?
2014-04-01T00:23:12  <mordred> I have dealt with proxy in all parts of infra _except_ in nodepool

2014-04-01T00:23:27  <mordred> clarkb, asselin: sudo blowing away the environment is going to be the thing killing you there
2014-04-01T00:23:32  <clarkb> I guess my 10 minute guestimate was bad
2014-04-01T00:23:41  <clarkb> mordred: oh right
2014-04-01T00:23:43  <asselin> yes. this is in prepare_node.sh

2014-04-01T00:23:53  <mordred> you can fix it by adding -E to the sudo command - but then you're forking prepare_node.sh
2014-04-01T00:24:01  <clarkb> fungi: note, I haven't actually tested 84278 so I am just going back to the old stuff for now

2014-04-01T00:28:54  <fungi> having nodepool abort and delete building nodes on sigusr1 is probably in order to speed this up next

2014-04-01T00:34:33  <clarkb> down to 5 building nodes now

2014-04-01T01:40:08  <tchaypo> If it's walking distance from home, that's probably not terrible
2014-04-01T01:40:43  <tchaypo> you get a comfy chair and the mindset-altering benefit of a dedicated "work" space, plus some exercise
2014-04-01T01:41:09  <clarkb> the exercise is quite important
2014-04-01T01:41:11  <persia> (short) commutes are good for thinking.  If you aren't lucky enough to have one, faking it by taking a 20 minute walk a couple times a day tends to increase productivity.
2014-04-01T01:41:58  <tchaypo> I've been breaking my day into two stints - the morning at home for review/triage/updating existing changesets, then I head into the city for lunch and do the new work in the afternoon from a library
2014-04-01T01:42:17  <tchaypo> I find the break does me good, and the different environments and times-of-day work well for the different kinds of work
2014-04-01T01:43:06  <persia> Requires a nice library, but that sounds like a lovely model.
2014-04-01T01:44:02  <clarkb> as the weathwr gets nicer I intend on doing waterfront hacking
2014-04-01T01:45:41  <tchaypo> I've got a passel of libraries within range of me - two different universities, the city council has a few nice branches (which even have free wifi), and the state library (although I haven't been there yet)

2014-04-01T03:14:53  <clarkb> dstufft: basically test-requirements says sphinx>=1.1.2,<1.2 and 1.2b3 is being installed which breaks us
2014-04-01T03:15:26  <clarkb> dstufft: with my manual testing I have installed every dep individually looking for the ones that install sphinx and it doesn't appear to install sphinx until it is explicitly called out in test-requirements.txt so I don't think this is transitive weirdness
2014-04-01T03:15:57  <clarkb> dstufft: any idea why Sphinx==1.2b3 is being installed?

2014-04-01T11:08:43  <amotoki> though it is removed in  the latest hacking repo but it is not released yet.
2014-04-01T11:08:55  <amotoki> it seems it is better to be updated.

2014-04-01T14:19:47  <fungi> Kiall: are you actually expecting to have milestone-proposed branches in python-designateclient? none of the official openstack python-fooclient projects do that as far as i know
2014-04-01T14:20:31  *** jgrimm has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-01T14:20:52  <fungi> Kiall: and milestone-proposed makes very little sense on a project unless you're going to use it as a staging area for future stable branches (which aren't reflected in the python-designateclient acl)
2014-04-01T14:21:45  *** markmcclain has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-01T14:21:49  *** adalbas has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-01T14:21:51  <Kiall> fungi: your're probably right about the client, but that side was just keeping things synced up
2014-04-01T14:22:30  <Kiall> (e.g. All-Projects does that for everything, and just overriding the Release Managers group here for designate-milesone)
2014-04-01T14:23:11  *** eharney has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-01T14:23:35  <fungi> Kiall: well, all-projects does a lot of things which only apply if you have a particular branch on your project. you chose not to do a stable/* ref section (which is also something all-projects has) so why milestone-proposed?
2014-04-01T14:23:47  *** basha has quit IRC
2014-04-01T14:24:18  <Kiall> Heh - I missed that obviously -_- Either way, I think your right about just removing that section.
2014-04-01T14:24:44  <fungi> Kiall: if you want to respin it without that section now, i'll go ahead and approve it for you
2014-04-01T14:24:55  <sdague> fungi: so, how do you feel about a ninja merge of this then? - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/84213/
2014-04-01T14:24:56  <Kiall> already on it, thanks :)
2014-04-01T14:25:03  <sdague> because that's the fix for the kibana issue
2014-04-01T14:25:15  <sdague> however it's deadlocked on ceilometer breaking stable
2014-04-01T14:25:45  <fungi> Kiall: it makes perfect sense on designate since that's a server project so you presumably expect to follow a release workflow similar to the other integrated servers, just not really relevant on python-designateclient
2014-04-01T14:25:57  <fungi> sdague: looking, but probably yes
2014-04-01T14:26:33  <fungi> sdague: on a related note, do you have any details on what ceilo needs to be doing to fix their migrations in havana?
2014-04-01T14:27:17  <openstackgerrit> Kiall Mac Innes proposed a change to openstack-infra/config: Sync up designate repo ACLs  https://review.openstack.org/84273

2014-04-01T14:28:58  <anteaya> Kiall: how many people in the designate-milestone group?
2014-04-01T14:29:07  <Kiall> Okay .. that should be the minimal set of items in the 2x designate ACLs without needlessly overriding anything we're already inheriting from All-Projects
2014-04-01T14:29:10  <sdague> alembic now requires code in sqla >= 9
2014-04-01T14:29:29  <sdague> so it's a requirements fix
2014-04-01T14:29:31  <anteaya> just wondering why designate needs more that -ptl and -core
2014-04-01T14:29:40  <sdague> which actually means we should be able to fix this the real way
2014-04-01T14:29:58  <Kiall> anteaya: right now it includes all the designate-core people, but may change over time
2014-04-01T14:30:03  *** skraynev is now known as skraynev_afk
2014-04-01T14:30:08  <fungi> anteaya: looks like if you merge it with the -core group (which is listed as an included group) and then de-dupe the results it's four humans
2014-04-01T14:30:18  <fungi> so not a ton
2014-04-01T14:30:20  *** nkinder has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-01T14:30:21  <Kiall> Also - the group is pre-exiting
2014-04-01T14:30:58  <fungi> Kiall: but anteaya does have a point, that you may want to consider the -milestone group roughly equivalent to the ptl and list of delegates performing release management duties, and drop the -core inclusion on it
2014-04-01T14:31:32  <Kiall> Yea, it just so happens that today those are the same group of people
2014-04-01T14:31:33  <fungi> though that's something you can do entirely through gerrit's group management interface

2014-04-01T14:42:36  <fungi> there were some other rax and hpcloud zones where the overnight image updates haven't succeeded for a day or two, but i was able to get images built in those after a few manual retries

2014-04-01T14:42:55  <anteaya> but az-2 still stonewalls

2014-04-01T14:47:31  <Kiall> I'm actually surprised nodepool does it that way, rather than using DIB and uploading the same image everywhere
2014-04-01T14:47:58  <fungi> Kiall: we haven't had glance available in our providers
2014-04-01T14:48:58  <fungi> Kiall: so we had to design it launching a template instance off a base image in the provider's existing catalog, modify that, shut it down and snapshot it
2014-04-01T14:49:29  <Kiall> Oh.. Well, yea - HP Cloud's new regions give you glance access if you ask for it
2014-04-01T14:50:10  <Kiall> No clue if RAX does the same though
2014-04-01T14:50:43  <fungi> Kiall: yep, and we have (and have tested it now successfully), but the new regions were also having other issues we've been trying to work around first (dns configuration strangeness, not enough cpu:ram ratio, high error rate on nova boot calls)
2014-04-01T14:51:17  <fungi> and rax also just started offering glance as well, though you have to do "special things" apparently to be able to make it work there at the moment

2014-04-01T15:10:51  <fungi> jeblair: not sure if you caught the scrollback, but while i was at dinner last night clarkb ended up restarting nodepool and discovered that the subnode changes were failing to write into the nonexistent /etc/nodepool dir on new nodes
2014-04-01T15:11:18  <sdague> jeblair / fungi: because this will change how a few things run in d-g jobs, https://review.openstack.org/#/c/84146/ would be good to make sure infra folks are on board with
2014-04-01T15:11:45  <sdague> dhellmann: actually your thoughts on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/84146/ would be welcome as well, I think it gets us out of the olso vs. pip issue once and for all
2014-04-01T15:11:47  <jeblair> fungi: ah yeah, that's created by the image build step; so i think we need to kick off image builds when we start with that version
2014-04-01T15:11:51  <fungi> he proposed a change to solve that, but in the interim rolled back the local clone on nodepool.o.o to the point where labels were introduced and then temporarily stopped puppet so we could consult with you

2014-04-01T15:13:22  <jeblair> fungi: yeah, that change won't work -- the user doesn't (necessarily) have permission to create that directory (it gets created world-writable)
2014-04-01T15:13:24  <sdague> just the old instincts on the breaks will change
2014-04-01T15:14:09  <sdague> because installing things from /opt into the system path will be a different behaviro
2014-04-01T15:14:15  <fungi> jeblair: how would you want to handle, e.g., being unable to get new images reliably in hpcloud-az2 for a while when we do that?
2014-04-01T15:14:26  <jeblair> fungi: so yes, that's probably the safest thing to do, though it'll slow new node creation for a bit.  we could merge a change that avoids writing to that directory and make this a two-parter
2014-04-01T15:14:26  <sdague> I'm hoping it just makes all things better

2014-04-01T15:42:41  <sdague> then pip install olso.vmware

2014-04-01T15:43:39  <fungi> is that a 2.9-only concern for now?
2014-04-01T15:43:46  <sdague> mordred: well, we only hit that issue yesterday :)
2014-04-01T15:43:51  <sdague> and I agree, it clarifies
2014-04-01T15:44:46  <mordred> sdague: but in general - develop/pip -e works by making symlinks to places /python .pth files - namespace pacakges use similar magic hacks

2014-04-01T15:45:43  <sdague> mordred: I keep asking that one :)
2014-04-01T15:46:04  <mordred> I mean, 'it looks nicer' is all well and good - but there isn't an actual technical benefit
2014-04-01T15:46:05  <sdague> however, I think the use case for pip install -e for libraries in devstack isn't sound anyway

2014-04-01T15:54:16  <cody-somerville> If one changes the min-ram value in nodepool, do you have to do anything special to deploy that change?
2014-04-01T15:55:09  <sdague> mordred: no worries, just curious. I hacked together a gpg version of it this weekend for personal use, was trying to figure out if it was of interest
2014-04-01T15:55:29  *** julienvey has quit IRC
2014-04-01T15:56:51  <mordred> sdague: I think too many of our puppet configs are too chatty (stuff that erroneously thinks it's changed every time) for it to be of use
2014-04-01T15:57:09  <fungi> yeah, idempotent exec blocks are a problem there
2014-04-01T15:57:24  <fungi> they run on every update and that shows as a change
2014-04-01T15:57:30  <jeblair> cody-somerville: theoretically, no, but if there's a bug it may need to be restarted.  also, depending on in what manner you changed it and the behavior of your cloud, launching new nodes from an image of a different size may or may not work.
2014-04-01T15:57:46  <sdague> fungi: sure, you definitely need to make the idempotent exec blocks have a creates or unless clause
2014-04-01T15:57:50  *** jlibosva has quit IRC

2014-04-01T15:58:09  <sdague> my config is only about 6 - 8 nodes
2014-04-01T15:58:22  <sdague> and pretty clean on runs, so it's handy to see when things update
2014-04-01T15:58:37  <cody-somerville> jeblair: Will it delete and recreate nodes that no longer meet min-ram requirement?
2014-04-01T15:59:21  <jeblair> cody-somerville: no

2014-04-01T16:23:43  <jogo> clarkb: ahh that explains the spike on http://jogo.github.io/gate/
2014-04-01T16:24:24  *** jgallard has quit IRC
2014-04-01T16:24:41  <sdague> jogo: what is the explanation?

2014-04-01T16:25:13  <jogo> sdague: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/84319/
2014-04-01T16:25:44  <sdague> oh, interesting
2014-04-01T16:25:58  <jogo> graphite shows things are fixed again
2014-04-01T16:26:07  <sdague> ok, so that was the big spike
2014-04-01T16:26:21  <jogo> heh yeah, that would result in a 100% failure
2014-04-01T16:26:33  <jogo> the graph hides that in its moving averaging
2014-04-01T16:26:55  <sdague> so how come that triggered the network bugs?
2014-04-01T16:27:07  <sdague> http://status.openstack.org/elastic-recheck/
2014-04-01T16:27:10  <jogo> sdague: well large-ops doesn't  create VMs
2014-04-01T16:27:13  <sdague> I didn't think they ran real ssh
2014-04-01T16:27:29  <sdague> ok, so how are the ssh tests failing at all?
2014-04-01T16:27:37  <sdague> because they shouldn't be run, right?
2014-04-01T16:27:37  <fungi> i believe the problem is that they weren't supposed to, and that's where it was breaking
2014-04-01T16:27:38  <jogo> sdague: it ran ssh by accident or something
2014-04-01T16:28:22  <fungi> yeah, because that comparison was missed, tests tried to ssh to not-real virtual machines
2014-04-01T16:28:22  <sdague> ok
2014-04-01T16:28:28  <jogo> sdague: it hit the else statement
2014-04-01T16:28:42  <jogo> which triggered smoke tests which then failed
2014-04-01T16:28:43  <sdague> and d-g doesn't gate on large-ops jobs?
2014-04-01T16:29:05  <fungi> the end result, of course, looks a lot like the bug where the instance doesn't come up and the ssh test legitimately fails
2014-04-01T16:29:09  <sdague> yep

2014-04-01T16:29:31  <zaro> fungi, mordred : I believe WIP will work on old change screen.  from my discussion with _david_ what doesn't work is that when you set/unset WIP the popup to provide a message does not work.
2014-04-01T16:29:37  <jogo> sdague: hmm good question

2014-04-01T16:30:39  <jogo> sdague: devstack gate does gate on large-ops
2014-04-01T16:30:53  <zaro> fungi, mordred : the change does get set into the correct state, but user just doen't get to enter a message for the state change.

2014-04-01T16:33:15  <jogo> sdague: then it got switched to 50
2014-04-01T16:33:27  <jogo> as we want to turn that from a bool (0,1) to the number of instances to boot
2014-04-01T16:33:27  <fungi> jogo: sdague: so the hole where we didn't gate on the actual bug trigger was the change to the jjb definition
2014-04-01T16:33:38  *** Sukhdev has quit IRC
2014-04-01T16:33:59  <sdague> ah, so it was layout change
2014-04-01T16:34:05  <sdague> which isn't currently gateable
2014-04-01T16:34:33  <jogo> sdague: correct I98baec6e0890f6b10afbd9858ded933f59db9725
2014-04-01T16:34:38  <jogo> in config
2014-04-01T16:34:39  <sdague> you know, that would be a kind of awesome thing to do, actually run the results of layout job changes
2014-04-01T16:34:51  <fungi> that's something else which might be more solvable in a post-jenkins world... testing the implications of alterations to the definitions of existing jobs
2014-04-01T16:34:55  <sdague> but it would be complicated
2014-04-01T16:34:56  *** zns has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-01T16:35:05  <sdague> fungi: yep
2014-04-01T16:35:25  <jogo> my limited understanding of this, is this would be a side effect of gozer. as they will need to produce code to automatically spin up an infra
2014-04-01T16:35:47  <dhellmann> sdague: we talked about that the other day -- I'm ok with it, and we'll see if it causes issues or confusions for devs working on those libs.
2014-04-01T16:36:15  <dhellmann> sdague: were you still seeing ns package issues?
2014-04-01T16:36:16  <zaro> mordred: i've been exposed! i'll keep your gerrit request on the peripheral.  i think i saw an openstack-ci bug on that already.
2014-04-01T16:37:02  <zaro> mordred: been assigning gerrit bugs to myself, but really just wanted to star them but didn't see a way to do that in LP.

2014-04-01T17:31:36  <jeblair> i don't understand why we would hit it though, i think we're using the same version as the other infra tools
2014-04-01T17:31:52  <fungi> jeblair: looking at test_node and test_subnodes, should we be calling pool.startup() instead of pool.start() maybe?

2014-04-01T17:34:09  <jogo> what is the status of python-openstackclient?
2014-04-01T17:34:15  <jogo> its not part of a program
2014-04-01T17:34:21  <mordred> jogo: that is its status
2014-04-01T17:34:30  <mordred> jogo: dtroyer may apply for a program for it
2014-04-01T17:34:36  <jogo> mordred: then it belongs in stackforge
2014-04-01T17:34:37  <jogo> ?
2014-04-01T17:35:00  <mordred> jogo: we had that discussion, which led to the idea that dtroyer needed to apply for a program potentially
2014-04-01T17:35:02  <jogo> and we shouldn't be deprecating other CLIs and say use openstackcl;ient
2014-04-01T17:35:04  <fungi> jogo: except we'd rather not go to the trouble of moving it twice in a short period of time

2014-04-01T17:36:11  <jogo> mordred: right, so the question is: keystoneclient doesn't have a v3 CLI instead they say use openstackclient
2014-04-01T17:36:28  <jogo> mordred: which is really awesome, but IMHO premature

2014-04-01T17:39:11  <dtroyer> jogo: I've been supportive of that since dolphm started saying it a while back…the Identity stuff is the most completely implemented set of commands in OSC of any of the APIs
2014-04-01T17:39:12  <jogo> stackforge/python-openstacksdk

2014-04-01T17:39:48  <mordred> jogo: I think that may or may not be a related thing, depending on what dtroyer pitches the scope of openstackclient to be
2014-04-01T17:40:00  <jogo> mordred: perhaps
2014-04-01T17:40:05  <dtroyer> The SDK projects are likely not going to be part of the initial program application based on what I know ATM, they will follow when they are ready...
2014-04-01T17:40:08  <mordred> jogo: the sdk is intended to be like openstackclient - except to be a single lib for devs to use
2014-04-01T17:40:19  <jeblair> yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
2014-04-01T17:40:24  <mordred> yah. I think it would be great to have both things - but I think the sdk is a bit younger
2014-04-01T17:40:28  <dtroyer> the python-openstackclinet will eventually be the bottom half of OSC...
2014-04-01T17:40:36  <jogo> dtroyer: I guess you can always ammend the charter for the program

2014-04-01T17:41:58  <jogo> re: use OSC
2014-04-01T17:42:23  <dtroyer> no, today OSC uses the existing client libs…when its ready, it'll be using the SDK
2014-04-01T17:42:45  <jogo> dtroyer: well from a governance point of view I mean.
2014-04-01T17:42:45  <anteaya> dtroyer: while we are talking programs and such, do you think devstack can rustle up a ptl candidate?
2014-04-01T17:42:45  <dtroyer> I expect that'll be some time based on how fast things seem to be going in this area
2014-04-01T17:43:01  <dtroyer> ah, well, we don't use them today
2014-04-01T17:43:27  <jogo> dtroyer: a program shouldn't be able to depreacte something in favor of something that *should* be in stackforge
2014-04-01T17:43:28  <dtroyer> and I expect that python-openstacksdk will be part of the program before we start shipping an OSc that uses it
2014-04-01T17:43:33  * anteaya notes that 8 programs still need at least one ptl candidate

2014-04-01T18:18:03  <clarkb> jeblair: for https://review.openstack.org/#/c/76057/4 I had a brilliant idea this morning. Would it be ok if I make TestScheduler's setUp() more modular, then introduce a second class that inherits from TestScheduler and sets gerrit.fetch_url and gerrit.poll? Then we would continue to test existing behavior and make sure that all of those tests work with the new behavior too. It will double the test
2014-04-01T18:18:05  <clarkb> count though
2014-04-01T18:18:20  <jogo> anteaya: that is the review to open up juno
2014-04-01T18:18:24  <clarkb> jeblair: its a bit of a hack to make it work, but is straightforward
2014-04-01T18:18:44  <jogo> and I went on the comments the systems added saying passed or failed

2014-04-01T18:27:34  <jeblair> (i had a gearman server running locally)
2014-04-01T18:28:17  <fungi> that explains the connection failures on the gearman socket in the logs. i glossed over them because i figured they were a symptom

2014-04-01T18:36:05  <clarkb> jeblair: is making the dir not the right solution?
2014-04-01T18:36:27  <clarkb> also I think it throws an IOError excepton if you want ot be more specific in the ignored error
2014-04-01T18:37:20  <jeblair> clarkb: the directory is created in the image build step; it didn't work yesterday because it was using old images
2014-04-01T18:38:20  <jeblair> clarkb: also, it raises "Exception" because it's the ssh client that does that (it raises Exception on any non-zero exit code of anything it runs)
2014-04-01T18:39:17  <openstackgerrit> Khai Do proposed a change to openstack-infra/config: update jenkins-dev.o.o with same plugins as jenkins.o.o  https://review.openstack.org/77040
2014-04-01T18:39:21  <clarkb> jeblair: right, but nodepool can create the dir
2014-04-01T18:39:26  *** e0ne has quit IRC
2014-04-01T18:39:32  <clarkb> jeblair: seems like nodepool should be responsible for that if it needs to write to that directory
2014-04-01T18:39:40  <jeblair> clarkb: nodepool _does_ create the dir -- in the image build

2014-04-01T18:40:41  <jeblair> clarkb: that's the only time it can create it because it might lose sudo after running the setup script
2014-04-01T18:40:43  <fungi> clarkb: this ties in with lifeless's comment yesterday about not assuming nodepool has root privs on the launched servers... it does on the template instance and sets /etc/nodepool 0x0777 at that point
2014-04-01T18:40:51  *** e0ne has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-01T18:41:13  <jeblair> fungi: yup
2014-04-01T18:41:26  <clarkb> fungi: no lifeless' comment was about not assuming nodepool had root on the nodepool daemon server
2014-04-01T18:41:56  <fungi> oh, then i entirely misunderstood what he was talking about in that case
2014-04-01T18:42:05  <clarkb> fungi: he misunderstood what I was saying too :)
2014-04-01T18:42:20  <fungi> free misunderstandings for everyone!
2014-04-01T18:42:27  <jeblair> i was about to go read the logs, but it sounds like it might not be the best use of time.  :)
2014-04-01T18:43:07  <clarkb> jeblair: is nodepool hardcoding the /etc/nodepool creation in code? or are users expected to know to create that dir?
2014-04-01T18:43:29  <clarkb> I think my biggest concern is whether or not users need to write special bash to make this work (and I don't remeber from reviews if nodepool does this regardless)

2014-04-01T20:04:08  <clarkb> jhesketh: jeblair I think that opens the door to doing more testing with non standard config
2014-04-01T20:04:42  <clarkb> so this will end up being another dns like situation. Not terrible but not great
2014-04-01T20:04:45  <clarkb> we can probably live iwth it
2014-04-01T20:04:48  <mordred> notmyname: well, we're REALLY close to starting to store stuff in swift - so there may be further follow up questions :)
2014-04-01T20:05:14  <notmyname> mordred: great!
2014-04-01T20:05:18  *** derekh has quit IRC
2014-04-01T20:05:38  <fungi> poking in the rax web dashboard, looks like each sub-user in a tenant gets assigned a dedicated api key. suspecting this means having to use the pyrax extension in the client?
2014-04-01T20:05:53  <jhesketh> clarkb: yeah, not sure how to bring that into tests for cloud providers besides just trying and seeing what works
2014-04-01T20:07:09  <fungi> oh, apparently they get a username and password too, so maybe normal client operations would support this
2014-04-01T20:08:47  *** CaptTofu has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-01T20:09:30  <fungi> ahh, the access controls in the rax dashboard, at least, are limited to either granting the account access to all containers, or none. there doesn't seem to be per-container granularity there
2014-04-01T20:10:46  <fungi> so we could limit the account to only be able to read and write (or only be able to read) all storage containers on the tenant and have no access to create servers, cinder volumes, et cetera if we wanted
2014-04-01T20:11:06  <jeblair> we could also go with public access
2014-04-01T20:11:10  <openstackgerrit> A change was merged to openstack-infra/nodepool: Protect against /etc/nodepool not existing  https://review.openstack.org/84492
2014-04-01T20:11:47  <jeblair> i'm not sure the cdn issues we had are actually blockers (i think it mostly had to do with making new dns cnames for each container)
2014-04-01T20:11:55  *** lcostantino has quit IRC
2014-04-01T20:12:15  <jeblair> but if we don't need to cname them at all, then it's not a big deal
2014-04-01T20:12:41  <fungi> more just wondering how we effectively limit write access per container
2014-04-01T20:13:21  <jeblair> fungi: yeah, that would still be good
2014-04-01T20:13:38  <jeblair> it's just possible we might want a container not controlled by zuul.  :)

2014-04-01T21:40:58  <salv-orlando> kevinbenton: if you're tracking this please assign bug 1301027 to yourself. I won't be around for long.

2014-04-01T21:49:14  <kevinbenton> i think it could be something related to the evaluation of '$state' in the unit tests

2014-04-01T23:18:44  <mattoliverau> Hey all, while building up Turbo-hipster nodes via nodepool, in my own environment, I use config/install_puppet.sh. As of this morning it is failing due to the pinned version of puppet-common needing to install a facter version of < 2.0.. so I think we will need to add anther pin. If I pin factor to version 1.* it workd s for me.
2014-04-01T23:19:04  <clarkb> mattoliverau: you may have solved asselin's problem

2014-04-01T23:20:08  <fungi> asselin: all i can figure is that it's a difference in the base image. we run this (so far) on base images provided by rackspace and hpcloud... maybe wherever your base image came from, it had puppet components pre-installed?
2014-04-01T23:20:13  <mattoliverau> clarkb: well your very welcome :P

2014-04-01T23:21:31  <jhesketh> clarkb: so there's no strong reason to move to less, but with grunt building the system it's pretty easy.. it'll also let us retheme for infra using variables rather than overriding css

2014-04-01T23:38:31  <fungi> mattoliverau: yeah, that seems like a good solution
2014-04-01T23:39:10  <fungi> mattoliverau: based on what i'm hearing, i expect if i try another image-update i'll see the same error you and asselin are
2014-04-01T23:39:24  <asselin> mattoliverau, that worked for me.
2014-04-01T23:39:56  <fungi> mgagne: that's too bad... cryptographically attesting to a release is... important
2014-04-01T23:40:24  <fungi> mgagne: especially to packagers and many end users
2014-04-01T23:41:44  <jeblair> jhesketh: i'm trying to be really honest here... i worry that the problem is that this change is about adding ~5 (i'm sure i'm not counting right) new tools that i have no experience with or understanding of their purpose or use
2014-04-01T23:41:47  <fungi> mgagne: anyway, i expect it's a baked-in assumption for pbr which would require a patch to change
2014-04-01T23:41:55  <mgagne> fungi: yha, I know. We can argue that it is only used for internal consumptions. Others might add that it doesn't matter and attesting releases of internal tools is as important as public ones.
2014-04-01T23:42:03  <jeblair> jhesketh: and i worry that writing docs about that in order to teach me about those probably isn't the right thing to do
2014-04-01T23:43:00  <jeblair> jhesketh: and also hypothetically if i understood all of them, would i think we got a benefit from them worth the cost of using them
2014-04-01T23:43:02  <clarkb> mgagne: ya, git describe --always doesn't seem to grok the unsigned tags
2014-04-01T23:43:08  <clarkb> mgagne: and that is what pbr is doing

2014-04-01T23:43:51  <jeblair> jhesketh: i was more inclined to say "let's just let the javascript experts put whatever they want there" a while back, but that's how we ended up with two status pages
2014-04-01T23:44:30  <asselin> mattoliverau, fungi out of curiosity, any reason install_puppet.sh is taken from opnstack-infra where the other scripts are scp to the instance?
2014-04-01T23:44:34  <mattoliverau> jeblair: don't worry, now jhesketh is the javascript expert :P

2014-04-01T23:45:06  <jhesketh> mattoliverau: oh goodness no!
2014-04-01T23:45:08  <mgagne> clarkb: As you might already know from previous conversations, we are using Jenkins to tag and perform most tasks which would normally be done by a human release manager. It partially explains why our tags aren't signed yet.
2014-04-01T23:45:20  <mattoliverau> fungi: I could be.... but I don't think I'm as efficient :P
2014-04-01T23:45:21  <jeblair> mattoliverau: until he realizes he doesn't actually like javascript.  then the status page is maintanerless again...
2014-04-01T23:45:25  <fungi> mattoliverau: that script is also used in other contexts, mainly

2014-04-01T23:50:36  <fungi> is this a potential inflection point for spinning the zuul status ui into a separate project and growing more api separation between it and zuul?
2014-04-01T23:50:41  <krotscheck> Oh, that one.

2014-04-01T23:51:15  <jeblair> fungi: i think zuul's api needs to be something other than read-only before that's truly useful
2014-04-01T23:51:24  <krotscheck> jeblair: A language you hate? ;)
2014-04-01T23:51:55  <jeblair> krotscheck: hate may be strong.  i'll own to dislike though.  :)
2014-04-01T23:51:57  <fungi> jeblair: granted

2014-04-01T23:53:09  <jeblair> krotscheck, jhesketh: anyway, i don't want to burn cycles on this now, i think we need mordred around to figure this out
2014-04-01T23:53:12  <jhesketh> fungi: that is something I'd like to see long term.. I don't like zuul having a wsgi app
2014-04-01T23:53:19  <krotscheck> Wow, that patch got a lot bigger.
2014-04-01T23:53:23  <jhesketh> yep +1
2014-04-01T23:53:45  <jhesketh> krotscheck: then I've gone and moved it around and fixed it : https://review.openstack.org/#/c/84069/
2014-04-01T23:54:10  <fungi> jeblair: just basically wondering whether that's where the ui work should first focus prior to something like mordred's proposed patch, and then once the api is robust enough to support such separation that separate suite of tools is less onerous to the backend server project
2014-04-01T23:55:18  <jeblair> fungi: everything about what you just said makes me thing more and more that the right answer is to ignore everything until we just fix the thing we set out to fix.  :)

2014-04-01T23:58:39  <krotscheck> fungi, jeblair: And maybe by then the node people will have their shit in order and have a recent set of packages available.
2014-04-01T23:59:16  <jeblair> krotscheck: anything's possible! :)
2014-04-01T23:59:33  <jeblair> i have to run for a bit
