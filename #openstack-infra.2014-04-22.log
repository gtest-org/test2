2014-04-22T00:41:34  *** nati_ueno has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-22T00:41:38  <jogo> since installing numy requires compiling C

2014-04-22T00:41:46  <superbee> if you install C deps does it just link instead?
2014-04-22T00:42:04  <mordred> I'm _Certain- that it does not
2014-04-22T00:42:13  <jogo> superbee: I tried apt-get install python-numpy and the venv didn't see it
2014-04-22T00:42:22  <jogo> mordred: how do I make a local wheel mirror?
2014-04-22T00:42:33  <mordred> jogo: you want to investigate the "pypi-mirror" command
2014-04-22T00:42:53  <mordred> that we use to build the openstack mirror - the tripleo guys all use it to make local mirrors for theselves too
2014-04-22T00:43:02  <mordred> it makes a wheel mirror as well as a non-wheel mirror
2014-04-22T00:43:19  <mordred> but if you have wheels, it'll speed things up
2014-04-22T00:43:29  <mordred> because you won't have to compile anything anymore
2014-04-22T00:43:33  <mordred> except for the first time

2014-04-22T04:03:57  <HenryG> I seem to have hit some kind of pip/pbr/setuptools misconfiguration and devstack fails to install.
2014-04-22T04:04:05  <HenryG> This is from my pip.log:  http://paste.openstack.org/show/76587/
2014-04-22T04:05:13  <HenryG> I tried updating pip and setuptools but that did not help.
2014-04-22T04:07:52  <superbee> jhesketh: because tox 1.7.0 is broken
2014-04-22T04:08:15  <superbee> jhesketh: and for a long time there was little indication upstream had any interest in fixing it (I pushed a patch even)
2014-04-22T04:08:24  <superbee> jhesketh: then it occured to me that make fixes this problem
2014-04-22T04:08:26  <superbee> so use make
2014-04-22T04:08:49  <jhesketh> superbee: any links to the problem descriptions?
2014-04-22T04:09:13  <superbee> sure
2014-04-22T04:09:58  <superbee> jhesketh: https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/tox/issue/150/posargs-configerror is the bug and https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/tox/pull-request/85/fix-command-expansion-and-parsing/diff is my proposed fix

2014-04-22T04:10:11  <superbee> I will concede my fix is not perfect because it adds a second backward incompat behavior change
2014-04-22T04:10:20  <superbee> but I also think it is the best and most correct option
2014-04-22T04:13:26  <jhesketh> superbee: so I don't really know enough about tox vs make to have a valid opinion, but surely changing systems altogether is a bit of an over reaction?

2014-04-22T04:13:42  <superbee> jhesketh: it probably is, but we should've used tox from the beginning
2014-04-22T04:13:44  <jhesketh> for example, what about work arounds or folking until your patch is merged
2014-04-22T04:13:47  <superbee> *shouldn't've
2014-04-22T04:13:56  <jhesketh> why's that?
2014-04-22T04:14:15  <superbee> jhesketh: so I considered forking tox too (botox it would be called), but make solved this problem 30 years ago. and is installed everywhere and everyone knows how to use it
2014-04-22T04:14:17  * mgagne brings popcorn
2014-04-22T04:14:24  <superbee> like using a tool other than make to do what make does is silly
2014-04-22T04:14:53  <jhesketh> fair call
2014-04-22T04:14:59  <superbee> I think people have an aversion to make because of the crazy things other have done with it
2014-04-22T04:15:10  <superbee> but my makefil that replaces tox is 34 lines long (with comments)
2014-04-22T04:15:41  <nibalizer> haha
2014-04-22T04:15:42  <superbee> jhesketh: fwiw I don't think my change should be merged. It was more of a "see this is how easy it would be to use make" change
2014-04-22T04:15:48  <nibalizer> "other make is bad, but mine is ok, trust me guys"
2014-04-22T04:16:03  <superbee> nibalizer: when compared to sendmail and NIS, exactly
2014-04-22T04:16:36  <nibalizer> superbee: why would you bring those things up
2014-04-22T04:16:43  <nibalizer> those are like trigger words for sysadmins
2014-04-22T04:16:47  <superbee> nibalizer: because they are the things that make people not want to use make
2014-04-22T04:16:55  <nibalizer> :)
2014-04-22T04:17:11  <nibalizer> fwiw if tox can't be convinced to back out their breaking changes, I'm all for finding new tooling
2014-04-22T04:17:31  <nibalizer> and make has this nice thing going for it: it is, and always will be, a part of the core unix utilities
2014-04-22T04:17:53  <mordred> yup. except don't forget not all of our peeps are on unix
2014-04-22T04:17:56  <superbee> jhesketh: so, don't review that change as a serious lets use make instead of tox for zuul

2014-04-22T04:19:35  <nibalizer> dude seriously
2014-04-22T04:19:46  <mgagne> nibalizer: the variable being in the manifest, not a global scope or something

2014-04-22T04:20:02  <superbee> I am actually pretty impressed at how simple it can be while replacing tox for zuul
2014-04-22T04:20:13  <superbee> now I didn't test that on windows or OS X
2014-04-22T04:20:14  <nibalizer> but we do scope.lookupvar() on a fully qualified variable $::foo::bar::baz
2014-04-22T04:20:47  <mordred> superbee: nice
2014-04-22T04:20:50  <nibalizer> I think we should be doing @var instead, but there is intertia towards scope.lookupvar() and old code that hasn't been changed yet
2014-04-22T04:21:30  <mordred> nibalizer: I think we should only use scope.lookupvar if we're referencing variables out of current odules
2014-04-22T04:21:32  <mordred> module
2014-04-22T04:21:32  <mgagne> nibalizer: most of the time, scope.lookupvar() isn't needed in our use cases AFAIK

2014-04-22T04:21:50  <mordred> but there are probably many places in our code where it's there because of Cargo Culting
2014-04-22T04:22:00  * mgagne goes on a refactor rampage
2014-04-22T04:22:01  <mordred> (we learned puppet by using it in production)
2014-04-22T04:22:05  <superbee> jhesketh: also I would be so happy if tox could somehow be made to see the light
2014-04-22T04:22:09  <superbee> but I was spending too much time on that
2014-04-22T04:22:31  <mordred> the biggest problem I have with tox is that it has aims to overlap with too many of the things we do, except not in ways we can use
2014-04-22T04:22:41  <nibalizer> mordred: also for the places where we need to get a varaible from a different scope we should expressly pull it into current scope by saying $localvar = $::somewhere::else::thing
2014-04-22T04:22:46  <mordred> like, it wants to be SUPER CI friendly, except it has a much much different version of CI than we do
2014-04-22T04:23:03  <mordred> nibalizer: yah. I can totally buy that
2014-04-22T04:23:05  <nibalizer> at the end of the day erb doesn't fail when it can't find stuff and just writes an empty string, which sux
2014-04-22T04:23:25  <nibalizer> in the puppet DSL we could put validate_string($var) if we wanted to code defensively
2014-04-22T04:23:27  <mordred> nibalizer: also, I grokked the in-tree hiera stuff more deeply over the weekend
2014-04-22T04:23:39  <mordred> nibalizer: so I'm ready for those patches to be ready and stuff
2014-04-22T04:23:42  <nibalizer> oh good!
2014-04-22T04:23:50  <nibalizer> i think they need a rebase..

2014-04-22T04:23:59  <mordred> but not deeply
2014-04-22T04:24:12  <nibalizer> oh right it needs us to decide if we want to keep enviormentally aware data on the master
2014-04-22T04:24:19  <superbee> mordred: my biggest problem with it is they can't figure out how to do the main thing they do

2014-04-22T04:24:47  <mgagne> nibalizer: you mean scope.lookupvar() will make ERB compilation fails if the variable is empty?

2014-04-22T04:25:19  <mgagne> nibalizer: or it was just an improvement we should make? (validating string)

2014-04-22T04:26:07  <nibalizer> mgagne: i'm talking about two separate channges, one is a change from scope.lookupvar() to @varname in erb templates; the other is to start doing validate_string($var) in puppet manifests to code defensively
2014-04-22T04:26:18  <mgagne> nibalizer: gotcha
2014-04-22T04:26:18  <mordred> nibalizer: see where we're passing in a mysql_host and mysql_password and mysql_user ?
2014-04-22T04:26:51  <nibalizer> yes
2014-04-22T04:26:57  <mordred> nibalizer: then, and I'm not 100% sure why - we hardcode the name storyboard for the db name: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/config/tree/modules/storyboard/templates/storyboard.conf.erb#n6
2014-04-22T04:27:09  <nibalizer> i've done create a db and add user/pass and give rights
2014-04-22T04:27:18  <mordred> yah. so that should work then
2014-04-22T04:27:31  <nibalizer> :|
2014-04-22T04:27:32  <mordred> the storyboard module should run the migrations
2014-04-22T04:27:48  * nibalizer is suspicious that storyboard doesn't read /etc/storyboard/storyboard.conf
2014-04-22T04:27:52  <mordred> http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/config/tree/modules/storyboard/manifests/init.pp#n116
2014-04-22T04:27:58  <mordred> I know that it does
2014-04-22T04:28:02  <nibalizer> someone was saying its /etc/storyboard.conf but that isnt' right either
2014-04-22T04:28:03  <mordred> because we changed the password the other day
2014-04-22T04:28:06  <nibalizer> hrrrrm
2014-04-22T04:28:16  <mordred> so I'm 100% certain it reads that file
2014-04-22T04:28:19  <nibalizer> i was about to ask you to move that file aside and prove to me it will break
2014-04-22T04:28:29  <mordred> nibalizer: have you tried running the migrations by hand?
2014-04-22T04:28:41  <mordred> it's possible that puppet skipped the signal to run them

2014-04-22T04:29:50  <mordred> and that does nothing?

2014-04-22T04:31:24  <mordred> oh - you have tables
2014-04-22T04:31:40  <mordred> so the migrations worked
2014-04-22T04:32:08  <nibalizer> thats as root, but i just verified that the user I created has read
2014-04-22T04:32:20  <nibalizer> i could try to insert but the error in the logs is on read
2014-04-22T04:32:36  <mordred> can you paste me the error in the logs?
2014-04-22T04:32:46  <mordred> (I think you did this before - but I wasnt' paying attention then)
2014-04-22T04:33:23  <mordred> and would you also paste the contents of your storyboard.conf (feel free to x out the password of course)
2014-04-22T04:33:28  <nibalizer> mordred: if you refresh the gist
2014-04-22T04:33:37  <nibalizer> the logs are in a commend
2014-04-22T04:33:39  <nibalizer> er comment
2014-04-22T04:34:17  <nibalizer> also the storyboard.conf (though github rendering has made it SUPERSIZE)
2014-04-22T04:34:31  <nibalizer> also i dont' have a superuser.yaml or a public IP

2014-04-22T04:39:12  <nibalizer> i left out the -h127.0.0.1
2014-04-22T04:39:18  <mordred> try tat
2014-04-22T04:39:18  <nibalizer> but yes
2014-04-22T04:39:20  <mordred> try that
2014-04-22T04:39:23  <mordred> it's different
2014-04-22T04:39:25  <mordred> than localhost
2014-04-22T04:39:42  <mordred> without it, mysql will connect over the socket, which has a different set of permissions in the host table
2014-04-22T04:39:52  <nibalizer> ya works fine
2014-04-22T04:39:59  <mordred> and you can select stuff?
2014-04-22T04:40:16  <nibalizer> unless 'select * from users' and and it returning nothing is code for "permission denied"
2014-04-22T04:40:24  <mordred> WEIRD
2014-04-22T04:40:32  <mordred> ok you win the prize
2014-04-22T04:40:47  <nibalizer> i can probably build some ssh tunnels to let you screen -x on this vm if you want
2014-04-22T04:41:32  <mordred> I'm actually about done for the night - but let's maybe do that tomorrow - because this is weirding me out

2014-04-22T10:19:00  <reed> re: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/81859 How about using the notation YYYY.1 or YYYY.2 instead of the codenames?
2014-04-22T10:19:09  <reed> I think it's more readable and future-proof. Have you thought about the naming scheme after Z?

2014-04-22T10:38:49  <markmc> reed, imho, most people struggle to remember the date based release names
2014-04-22T10:39:32  <reed> markmc, what do you mean? the association between 2014.1 and icehouse?
2014-04-22T10:40:42  <markmc> reed, yes; 2014.1 isn't something that most folks associate with anything

2014-04-22T10:40:52  <reed> I don't have a strong opinion though, I think that codenames are quite silly and drive me nuts sometimes when I need to remember the dates
2014-04-22T10:41:21  <reed> 2014.1 is self descriptive: incubation started in 2014, first half
2014-04-22T10:41:35  <sdague> SergeyLukjanov: can you +A this through? Tempest is broken until it lands - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/89383/
2014-04-22T10:42:02  <reed> IMO quite more explicit than 'incubated-since: icehouse'
2014-04-22T10:42:21  <reed> one can say that at least our codenames are in alphabetic order
2014-04-22T10:42:49  <reed> so one could calculate the release date based on the current codename's cycle
2014-04-22T10:43:37  <reed> so during  K cycle, if I read 'incubated-since: Juno' I will know that incubation started in ... wait... 2014.2?
2014-04-22T10:46:32  <markmc> dates don't matter as much as "number of cycles ago" maybe
2014-04-22T10:46:50  <markmc> anyway, point is we don't talk about 2014.1 nearly as much as icehouse
2014-04-22T10:47:09  <sdague> yeh, even the press refers to things by code names

2014-04-22T11:39:08  <ttx> about release names vs. release numbers, as heartbleed showed, a good name has 100 times the marketing power of an obscure number.
2014-04-22T11:39:21  <ttx> But then, the name and the number are actually DIFFERENT things
2014-04-22T11:39:28  <ttx> the name is linked to the CYCLE.
2014-04-22T11:39:35  <ttx> the number is linked to the RELEASE

2014-04-22T11:39:53  <ttx> I think a lot of the confusion is due to peolpe not understanding that difference.
2014-04-22T11:40:10  <ttx> We are already in the Juno cycle. Which will culminate with 2014.2 release.

2014-04-22T11:40:48  <ttx> So putting "2014.2" there just wouldn't make sense.

2014-04-22T16:27:46  <jogo> krotscheck: AFAIK he is in Australia somewhere

2014-04-22T16:29:38  <jbooboo> krotscheck: i can fill you in
2014-04-22T16:30:08  <jbooboo> krotscheck: the status page at http://status.openstack.org/zuul/ is the most up to date
2014-04-22T16:30:15  <krotscheck> jbooboo: superbee told me that it’s an effort to bring the infra-zuul in line with what’s actually in the repo, and then to layer on whitelabeling, right?

2014-04-22T16:31:40  <anteaya> can you provide more details?
2014-04-22T16:31:45  <jogo> what IP do you see for launchpad?
2014-04-22T16:31:58  <jogo> anteaya: server just times out, no response

2014-04-22T16:32:16  <jbooboo> krotscheck: if it succeeds in being something that we can make look like the page here: http://status.openstack.org/zuul/ then very likely
2014-04-22T16:32:26  <arosen1> jogo:  you?
2014-04-22T16:32:32  <jogo> same
2014-04-22T16:32:36  <jogo> jbooboo: what IP do you have?
2014-04-22T16:32:38  <jbooboo> krotscheck: after all, that page has kept up with changes in zuul, while the one in the tree has not, preciely because we don't run it.
2014-04-22T16:32:51  <jbooboo> jogo: same
2014-04-22T16:32:52  <krotscheck> jbooboo: There’s shitty code in that review. use of inline styles all over the place. I can let it slide, but I don’t actually see where that code was copied from (i think it’s new). If there’ll be concerted effort to make-things-better, great. Otherwise....
2014-04-22T16:33:35  <jogo> jbooboo: thanks
2014-04-22T16:33:38  <jogo> arosen1: very odd
2014-04-22T16:33:53  <arosen1> jogo:  yea i saw this occurring last night too
2014-04-22T16:34:06  <jbooboo> krotscheck: it's mostly copied from the current openstack status page.  i wrote most of it and jhesketh is making it a little bit better.
2014-04-22T16:34:10  <anteaya> same ip for me too
2014-04-22T16:34:17  <krotscheck> jbooboo: Got it
2014-04-22T16:34:26  <krotscheck> So, good for now, we’d love to improve it later?
2014-04-22T16:35:02  <arosen1> jogo:  it seems like my service provider or something. If I ssh -D and set firefox to use a socks proxy things work.
2014-04-22T16:35:12  <jbooboo> krotscheck: yep.  there's a real opportunity here....
2014-04-22T16:35:17  <jogo> arosen1: huh
2014-04-22T16:35:20  <jogo> who is your provider?
2014-04-22T16:35:28  <jogo> AFAIK I am comcast
2014-04-22T16:35:29  <krotscheck> jbooboo: Yeah yeah yeah, subtext.
2014-04-22T16:35:41  <arosen1> jogo: i think comcast
2014-04-22T16:35:48  <jbooboo> krotscheck: basically, zuul should have a functioning status page included

2014-04-22T16:36:10  <krotscheck> jbooboo: What’s the architectural hope there: Separate client, or baked-in?
2014-04-22T16:36:11  <jbooboo> krotscheck: the wikipedia folks like the plain bootstrap look; our page needs to look like http://status.openstack.org/zuul/
2014-04-22T16:36:43  <jbooboo> krotscheck: so we need something that supports both.  you know, power of css and all.
2014-04-22T16:36:47  <reed> jbooboo, https://review.openstack.org/#/c/89302/ can we relax the rules to approve new mailing lists? make them like new addition to planet, one +2 is enough
2014-04-22T16:36:57  <reed> ?
2014-04-22T16:37:00  <krotscheck> jbooboo: I just landed simple whitelabeling in storyboard.
2014-04-22T16:37:22  <krotscheck> jbooboo: Is zuul under the same package restrictions as openstack, or is it more fluid like storyboard?
2014-04-22T16:37:39  <krotscheck> I’m guessing more fluid.
2014-04-22T16:37:53  *** markmc has quit IRC
2014-04-22T16:37:53  <jbooboo> krotscheck: it's a very simple read-only "client" right now, so it doesn't need to be complicated
2014-04-22T16:38:00  <jbooboo> krotscheck: not sure i understand your question about package restrictions
2014-04-22T16:38:40  <arosen1> jogo:  actually i can traceroute all the way to launchpad.net and even ping it
2014-04-22T16:38:40  <krotscheck> jbooboo: Just thinking about what tooling is available to generate the CSS
2014-04-22T16:39:06  <krotscheck> jbooboo: Might be a good idea to see if there’s a LESS/SASS compiler written in python
2014-04-22T16:39:20  <jogo> it seems to hang on ssl or something
2014-04-22T16:39:30  <krotscheck> jbooboo: Found one.
2014-04-22T16:39:32  <krotscheck> Hrm
2014-04-22T16:39:33  <jbooboo> reed: code reviews are to help avoid errors; errors in mailing lists are hard to correct, i don't think we should relax those requirements
2014-04-22T16:39:38  <jogo> arosen1: which makes sense comcast be evil

2014-04-22T16:40:39  <reed> jbooboo, besides, waiting two days kills momentum in groups
2014-04-22T16:41:06  <reed> jbooboo, to frame the issue, creating a google group is instantaneous
2014-04-22T16:42:08  <reed> jbooboo, once the request comes from me or Tom, or is reviewed and approved by me/Tom, it should be approved asap
2014-04-22T16:42:10  <jbooboo> reed: that's not a way to be a part of the community.  this community is built on equal access to shared resources mediated by peer review.
2014-04-22T16:42:44  <reed> jbooboo, I understand all that and I agree with you, I'm just stating needs from the community
2014-04-22T16:42:52  <jbooboo> reed: we do review and approve requests as soon as possible.

2014-04-22T16:53:18  <krotscheck> jbooboo: Oh, ease of whitelabeling. If we can describe our various themes in terms of a few variables, we can generate all kinds of different branded zuuls
2014-04-22T16:53:57  <krotscheck> jbooboo: For example, HP might want its links to be HP-blue while Redhat wants red.
2014-04-22T16:54:26  <krotscheck> I’m digging thorough the zuul code right now, coming up with a few options.
2014-04-22T16:55:01  *** jcoufal has quit IRC
2014-04-22T16:55:12  <krotscheck> On one side, we could do a JIT, cached CSS file that is regenerated on GET and whenever someone edits a configuration file.
2014-04-22T16:55:23  <krotscheck> On the other, it could be part of the install process.
2014-04-22T16:56:00  <krotscheck> Or it could be pre-packaged.

2014-04-22T16:56:44  <krotscheck> That’s why I want to talk to jhesketh, because I’d love to know what his thoughts are.
2014-04-22T16:59:56  <jbooboo> krotscheck: i hesitate to ask, but what's wrong with semantic use of css?
2014-04-22T17:01:12  <jbooboo> krotscheck: why can't we just use say, a 'build-failed' class and then let people write their own css files that say that 'build-failed' is red
2014-04-22T17:02:11  <jbooboo> krotscheck: the concerns with using more tools are: a number of our users package this, and so adding new tools means potentially more work for them (unless they are already packaged).  i think less may be problematic here.

2014-04-22T17:02:56  <jbooboo> that's actually how we got into this mess; someone did a drive-by refactor and never updated it again
2014-04-22T17:03:25  <jbooboo> krotscheck: so if it gets rebuilt using a bunch of tools i don't understand, we'll just repeat the process

2014-04-22T17:16:33  <krotscheck> jbooboo: Essentially there’s no real difference between a compiled CSS file and an if-custom-theme-file-exists statement.

2014-04-22T17:16:57  <annegentle> superbee: usually I'd say "docs.o.org all the things" but in this case the audience expects developer.openstack.org (not api.openstack.org). So Im' trying to not only correct an incorrectly named subdomain but also meet expectations/standards
2014-04-22T17:17:05  <krotscheck> jbooboo: And since CSS allows for all kinds of tasty overrides, that could be the path of least resistance.
2014-04-22T17:17:32  <superbee> annegentle: how do we know the audience expects that?
2014-04-22T17:17:39  <annegentle> superbee: and since we have two dev audiences, let's meet expectations for the one that'll be bigger (200,000 users vs 2,000)
2014-04-22T17:17:43  <superbee> as a developer consuming openstack stuff I would google for 'openstack docs'

2014-04-22T17:20:27  <superbee> as someone that consumes both user and dev docs for say github it is really aggravating that everything doesn't live in the same location

2014-04-22T17:22:01  <superbee> annegentle: I think the best way to do that is to put all of the documentation in one easy to find place. docs.o.o/foo docs.o.o/bar and so on
2014-04-22T17:22:26  <annegentle> superbee: that's not the way the rest of the world is going with REST API docs, though
2014-04-22T17:22:29  <superbee> then if you need host aliases layer that on top
2014-04-22T17:22:40  <superbee> annegentle: and they are wrong
2014-04-22T17:23:00  <superbee> you can still have host aliaes
2014-04-22T17:23:18  <superbee> but I should be able to nav between different types of docs to get a full picture or when I context switch and so on

2014-04-22T17:26:44  <jbooboo> superbee: redirect?
2014-04-22T17:27:07  <superbee> redirect or another vhost to give people an illusion or whatever
2014-04-22T17:27:11  <annegentle> superbee: thing is, why not a separate experience for app developers? We already know our docs.o.org nav is overloaded and clunky... not to conflate but seems like we do app devs a disservice
2014-04-22T17:27:36  * annegentle loves to conflate
2014-04-22T17:27:47  <superbee> annegentle: because if you are doing app development against your private cloud and want to check docs for both sides now you have to do a second google search
2014-04-22T17:27:59  <superbee> and general discoverability

2014-04-22T17:28:11  <superbee> to me it is unintutive that we would have a docs site and host docs elsewhere
2014-04-22T17:28:14  <annegentle> superbee: private clouds I know of are already consuming upstream docs for their users
2014-04-22T17:29:10  <annegentle> superbee: docs site = standing up openstack, written by openstack contributors (2,000 potential) devdocs site = consuming openstack, written by consumers of those thousands of private clouds and handfuls of public clouds?
2014-04-22T17:29:26  <annegentle> superbee: now that vision is a long way off, but that's my thinking, give a different experience
2014-04-22T17:29:30  <superbee> annegentle: I get that that is how you want to frame it but docs are docs
2014-04-22T17:29:34  <superbee> I expect all the docs to be on the docs site

2014-04-22T17:31:48  <annegentle> superbee: that overloads the docs team and docs site I think, it's unsustainable (from a contrib standpoint) and doesn't serve those dev users in a way they're expecting.

2014-04-22T17:33:51  <annegentle> superbee: I realize google is most people's entry point but in the list of returned hits, as an app dev, you'd go for developer.openstack.org first, thinking "hey that's for me" -- also there's no reason for app devs to know how the delicious openstack is made, only that they can consume it to their fill

2014-04-22T17:37:43  <annegentle> superbee: Really, just correcting for mistakenly having api.openstack.org a few years back -- by naming it correctly based on standards for REST API docs
2014-04-22T17:38:00  <superbee> annegentle: yup and imo the renaming should be docs.o.o

2014-04-22T17:50:22  <jogo> so I ran skip slow on all of nova and it only saved 6 or 6 seconds out of 80
2014-04-22T17:50:23  <superbee> etoews_: I agree there are different audiences. I don't agree that each audience deservers a differently indexed set of documentation
2014-04-22T17:50:28  <jogo> which makes sense, because we only import things once
2014-04-22T17:50:39  <jogo> so skip slow currently makes small runs much faster
2014-04-22T17:50:47  <sdague> right
2014-04-22T17:50:54  <sdague> however, that's for the project wide case
2014-04-22T17:50:56  <etoews_> we're making developer.o.o the destination for developers on openstack. it the much wider world (beyond openstack itself) it's well understood that developer.whatever.tld is the place for developers on top of a platform.

2014-04-22T17:51:13  <sdague> it's a separate invoke for each file
2014-04-22T17:51:14  <superbee> etoews_: right and my assertion is that the wider world fails at this
2014-04-22T17:51:25  <superbee> etoews_: using the github docs as both a user and api consumer is frustrating
2014-04-22T17:51:29  <superbee> for example
2014-04-22T17:51:44  <superbee> we shouldn't do a thing just because twitter and github did it

2014-04-22T17:52:31  <jogo> as this is inherently very parallelizable
2014-04-22T17:52:44  <jogo> trivially so on the file level
2014-04-22T17:52:46  <annegentle> superbee: yeah they're narrowly focused and a single product/single API, but we've had good results with developer.rackspace.com in serving this particular user
2014-04-22T17:53:20  <superbee> annegentle: I disagree about that as well :)

2014-04-22T17:53:29  <annegentle> superbee: I worry that we need to follow standards (ill-defined as they are) if we're trying to make a standard
2014-04-22T17:54:00  <superbee> for example that rbac stuff. had to find that in a blog post
2014-04-22T17:54:19  <openstackgerrit> Marc Abramowitz proposed a change to openstack-infra/jenkins-job-builder: Add a "list" command  https://review.openstack.org/87090

2014-04-22T17:54:57  <superbee> and my point is that everyone would be better served if the docs lived on the doc site
2014-04-22T17:55:21  <superbee> if you find that too much of the world is trained to type developer.foo.bar then add an cname/redirect/whatever

2014-04-22T17:56:28  <etoews_> if that's the case and if a developer goes to docs.o.o and tells google to tell me about nova. 80% of the hits are going to be about how to deploy nova.
2014-04-22T17:56:45  <etoews_> it a signal to noise problem.
2014-04-22T17:57:00  <etoews_> we need to give developers lots of signal.

2014-04-22T17:57:12  <superbee> etoews_: the inverse is true of developers.o.o. I will search and get zero hits for nova api

2014-04-22T18:01:22  <superbee> it is still confusing
2014-04-22T18:01:33  <jbooboo> i will say that if we have developer(s?).openstack.org, docs.o.o/developer could get really confusing
2014-04-22T18:01:45  <etoews_> the numbers do matter. this is what the wider world understands. it's those the developer of applications on openstack that we need to attract.
2014-04-22T18:01:57  <superbee> etoews_: and why can't we do that with docs.o.o?
2014-04-22T18:02:03  <jbooboo> (i'm guessing that was why we used api to start with)

2014-04-22T18:04:04  <etoews_> jbooboo: i've thought about  docs.o.o/developer already. i'll make a commit to that page to make it very clear who the audience for it is.
2014-04-22T18:04:08  <superbee> useful to linux kernel hackers and sysadmins
2014-04-22T18:04:27  <etoews_> annegentle: yes.

2014-04-22T18:04:58  <sdague> it seems like what the site is called should be pretty secondary, honestly. If docs.o.o/developer can't be organized well enough to be useful, I don't understand how a cname fixes that :)

2014-04-22T18:05:35  <superbee> whoever thought info was a good thing should really rethink that. And I think this is a similar sort of partition we are introducing
2014-04-22T18:05:40  <jbooboo> sdague: the content api.openstack.org is the main point of discussion (and would be the starting content for developer.openstack.org)
2014-04-22T18:05:47  <sdague> gotcha
2014-04-22T18:05:48  <superbee> oh you want to read this more in depth doc about some subject good luck
2014-04-22T18:07:12  <superbee> NobodyCam: they are running, probably an hour tops
2014-04-22T18:07:12  <etoews_> it's also about developer expectations.
2014-04-22T18:07:18  <annegentle> sdague: superbee: and it's an sdk download point also so not just docs (It's not just me over-organizing content)
2014-04-22T18:07:21  <ravikumar_hp> Is Devstack can setup Trove ?
2014-04-22T18:07:42  <sdague> ravikumar_hp: yes, it's not enabled by default though
2014-04-22T18:07:54  <etoews_> this is what developers expect:

2014-04-22T18:08:39  <sdague> etoews_: comparing openstack.org to companies might be the wrong comparison though. What about hadoop.org, apache.org, kernel.org?
2014-04-22T18:09:17  <Mithrandir> people go to sites and don't just mash keywords into their favourite search engine?
2014-04-22T18:09:37  <superbee> Mithrandir: its the post mash keywords expection that I am trying to deal with
2014-04-22T18:09:50  <superbee> if I land on docs.o.o or developer.o.o I am now on an island
2014-04-22T18:11:54  <etoews_> sdague: i don't think so considering the service provider nature of openstack.
2014-04-22T18:12:12  <etoews_> superbee: right. an island full of glorious signal.
2014-04-22T18:12:52  <etoews_> as a developer, i don't want to see anything about how to deploy openstack or hadoop or whatever. i just want to get something done.
2014-04-22T18:13:18  *** pblaho has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-22T18:13:35  <superbee> etoews_: there is no reason we can't achieve that with docs.o.o for you
2014-04-22T18:13:49  <superbee> but we can also make it easy to disover the other side if using a central location
2014-04-22T18:14:01  <superbee> if you want to ignore how the sausage is made thats fine
2014-04-22T18:14:06  <SlickNik> ravikumar_hp: If you have any other questions on how to setup trove (using devstack), feel free to pop in and ask them on #openstack-trove. We're always happy to help out.
2014-04-22T18:14:08  <superbee> but we shouldn't make it harder for everyone

2014-04-22T18:14:27  <ravikumar_hp> sure SlickNik:
2014-04-22T18:14:53  <superbee> fwiw I agree with sdage
2014-04-22T18:15:04  <superbee> the comparison to other large open source projects would be more valid
2014-04-22T18:15:27  <etoews_> superbee: "everyone" in that context is an overstatement.
2014-04-22T18:15:36  *** locke105 has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-22T18:16:14  <etoews_> everyone = developers who want to develop applications on openstack *and* deploy openstack *and* develop openstack itself?
2014-04-22T18:16:34  <superbee> etoews_: everyone is anyone looking for openstack documentation
2014-04-22T18:16:48  <etoews_> what kind of documentation?
2014-04-22T18:16:52  <superbee> etoews_: all of it
2014-04-22T18:17:12  <etoews_> why would they want to see all of it? what purpose would that serve?
2014-04-22T18:17:23  <superbee> etoews_: I think you are misinterpretting what I am trying to say
2014-04-22T18:17:43  <superbee> etoews_: I don't think everyone needs to see all of it. I do think that all of our docs are docs and shouldn't be treated special
2014-04-22T18:17:57  <superbee> etoews_: so that regardless of what you do need it is clear where to find it even when what you need changes
2014-04-22T18:18:07  <superbee> etoews_: for example man pages
2014-04-22T18:18:11  *** Ryan_Lane1 has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-22T18:18:47  <superbee> they are all located in one place. Divided into navigable sections so that as needs change I don't have to look someplace else
2014-04-22T18:19:12  <sdague> etoews_: is there a reason the content restructure couldn't happen first, then make a decision later to pull the content up a level. It seems like the name of the url, given that everyone is going to get there via google, is something that could be sorted later
2014-04-22T18:19:34  <etoews_> navigable maybe (that's a helluva lot of content). searchable no.
2014-04-22T18:19:53  <sdague> etoews_: why not?
2014-04-22T18:20:14  <etoews_> sdague: ummm...why not what exactly?
2014-04-22T18:20:27  <sdague> why it becomes not searchable?
2014-04-22T18:21:41  <etoews_> because you have all of the docs in one domain, trying to treat the audience homogeneously. you're going to get a ton of hits that have nothing to do with what you really want to accomplish. low signal.
2014-04-22T18:21:43  <sdague> is that just a technology problem? like we don't have a setup to boost developer docs when in /developer
2014-04-22T18:22:30  <SergeyLukjanov> is it safe to approve gerritbot/accessbot change while meetings are running?
2014-04-22T18:22:36  <SergeyLukjanov> jbooboo, superbee ^^
2014-04-22T18:22:48  <etoews_> not just a tech problem. developers have expectations about where to find docs and how they are presented to them.

2014-04-22T18:23:08  <jbooboo> SergeyLukjanov: yes, only config changes for meetbot (eavesdrop) are dangerous

2014-04-22T18:26:06  <superbee> it sounded like the run yesterday was a success but that it took a long time. Is that something that needs to be fixed prior to approving changes unsupervised?

2014-04-22T18:29:34  <anteaya> I would look on gerrit .bash_history

2014-04-22T19:32:22  <jlk> Is there a place to talk about generic jenkins-job-builder issues, using it in our own infrastructure?
2014-04-22T19:32:36  <superbee> jlk: here is fine. We don't have a specific channel for it

2014-04-22T19:33:06  *** shakamunyi has quit IRC
2014-04-22T19:33:06  <jlk> So I'm working on a job-template, job-group, project setup
2014-04-22T19:33:24  <jlk> and I've got one template, two groups, two projects
2014-04-22T19:33:53  <jlk> In the template, there is an email publisher
2014-04-22T19:34:06  <jlk> in /one/ of the job-groups, I want to add a trigger publisher
2014-04-22T19:34:25  *** _nadya_ has quit IRC
2014-04-22T19:34:29  <jlk> but my trails have resulted in errors, in that the additional publisher doesn't seen be being picked up in the written out XML.
2014-04-22T19:34:50  <jlk> have any of you ran into this, or can you suggest a way to get an extra trigger in one of the generated job (sets)?
2014-04-22T19:34:52  <superbee> jlk: you will need a second template with the additional publisher
2014-04-22T19:35:00  <jlk> damn.
2014-04-22T19:35:11  <jlk> any way to make that second template inherit everything from the first?
2014-04-22T19:35:11  *** _nadya_ has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-22T19:35:13  <superbee> if the actual structure of the job is different tha trequires a second job
2014-04-22T19:35:21  <superbee> jlk: I don't think so
2014-04-22T19:35:38  <jlk> seems lame to have to copy/paste 20+ lines, just to add an additional trigger
2014-04-22T19:35:48  <superbee> thats how jenkins works
2014-04-22T19:36:02  <superbee> jjb could abstract it away but doesn't

2014-04-22T19:36:59  *** wenlock has quit IRC
2014-04-22T19:37:37  <jlk> so if the jobs to be generated are exactly the same, but with the addition of or alteration of publishers, it gets a whole new template.
2014-04-22T19:37:39  <superbee> jlk: what you could do is add the trigger to the job then make it noop if you don't need it
2014-04-22T19:37:55  <jlk> can the publishers section itself be per-job-group, something added in there that goes beyond the original tempalte?
2014-04-22T19:37:58  <superbee> jlk: yes anything that changes the structure of a job (eg not just a variable) needs a new template
2014-04-22T19:38:16  <superbee> because jenkins itself doesn't do conditional disabling of job chunks
2014-04-22T19:38:26  <superbee> and a JJB job maps to a jenkins job today
2014-04-22T19:38:39  <superbee> we could do more abstraction on top of that but don't beyond the current templates
2014-04-22T19:39:32  *** hewbrocca has quit IRC
2014-04-22T19:40:01  <jlk> I suppose I could make some of these parts macros
2014-04-22T19:40:08  <jlk> since the builders part is the same
2014-04-22T19:40:14  <superbee> that has been our approach
2014-04-22T19:40:24  <superbee> condense down into macros then the copy pasta isn't terrible

2014-04-22T19:48:35  <jlk> yeah, more text

2014-04-22T19:48:58  <sdague> heh
2014-04-22T19:49:12  <sdague> that seems sub optimal :)
2014-04-22T19:49:22  <krotscheck> sdague: (fair warning, you’re fake-proxying to prod. If you want to hit your local instances it’s tox -egrunt server)
2014-04-22T19:49:33  <sdague> yeh, I need some prod data
2014-04-22T19:49:36  <krotscheck> sdague: It’s only like that when you proxy against prod.
2014-04-22T19:49:45  <krotscheck> sdague: If you’re running all local it’s not.
2014-04-22T19:50:03  <krotscheck> sdague: Though, yeah, we should fix that.
2014-04-22T19:50:39  <jlk> superbee: ok, you've been great so far, one more thing.
2014-04-22T19:50:59  <jlk> superbee: I want a value to come from job-group, get passed through job-template, and through again to macro
2014-04-22T19:51:04  <jlk> eg region:
2014-04-22T19:51:09  <jlk> region: is defined in job-group
2014-04-22T19:51:20  <superbee> jlk: we have an example of that somewhere, one sec
2014-04-22T19:51:29  <jlk> then I have macro-name: \n region: {region}
2014-04-22T19:51:33  <jlk> and that's throwing errors.

2014-04-22T21:14:13  <superbee> that was easier than I expected. The label:code-review,self query is new
2014-04-22T21:14:39  <mordred> superbee: if I have reviewed one of those chagnes, it still shows up in my list of thigns to review
2014-04-22T21:14:55  <superbee> also apparnetly pushing that to a different refs/meta/dashboards/* ref was not a good idea. We should be sure to use only one ref
2014-04-22T21:15:08  <superbee> makes the listing of dashboards ugly
2014-04-22T21:16:03  <superbee> mordred: it correctly removed my test change for me
2014-04-22T21:16:12  <mordred> oh. weird
2014-04-22T21:16:31  <sdague> superbee: label:code-review,self mean on the existing patch, or ever on the change?

2014-04-22T21:19:07  <superbee> mordred: actually wait that looks right
2014-04-22T21:19:19  <sdague> if label:code-review,self does what you said it does

2014-04-22T21:42:15  <superbee> http://paste.openstack.org/show/76696/ is what is in place now
2014-04-22T21:42:21  <superbee> so everyone can see the queries
2014-04-22T21:42:23  <zaro> jbooboo, superbee : updates to openstack/2.8.4 branch, there are 4 changes. https://review.openstack.org/#/c/89698
2014-04-22T21:42:24  <anteaya> I encourage submissions, I just don't want them merged until the code is baked
2014-04-22T21:42:26  *** pdmars has quit IRC
2014-04-22T21:43:10  <superbee> there may be a way for us to make projects inherit that query and apply it only to that particular project
2014-04-22T21:43:16  <superbee> which might be neat too
2014-04-22T21:43:21  <superbee> but isn't necessary for old functionality
2014-04-22T21:44:16  <superbee> nope doesn't look like it
2014-04-22T21:44:44  <superbee> do we want to set a limit?
2014-04-22T21:44:49  <superbee> for each query?
2014-04-22T21:45:26  *** pdmars_ has quit IRC
2014-04-22T21:45:28  <superbee> anyways that paste should cover us for the upgrade
2014-04-22T21:46:54  <mordred> anteaya: we change that in our gerrit usually - "submit" is gerrit speak for "merge" or "land this patch"
2014-04-22T21:47:10  <mordred> anteaya: none of us normally see the submit button, because zuul is teh one who presses it
2014-04-22T21:47:22  <mordred> anteaya: so the wording makes more sense in a normal gerrit installation
2014-04-22T21:48:12  <jbooboo> we should make sure our alternate wording is in place in 2.8
2014-04-22T21:49:25  <superbee> now to document my process. I added myself to project bootstrappers group first (for push perms). Then I did mkdir -p dashboards/All-Projects && cd dashboards/All-Projects && git init && git remote add gerrit ssh://cboylan@review-dev.openstack.org:29418/All-Projects && vi important-changes-dashboard && git add important-changes-dashboard && git commit && git push gerrit
2014-04-22T21:49:27  <superbee> HEAD:refs/meta/dashboards/important-changes
2014-04-22T21:49:38  <zaro> superbee: lgtm.  nice work
2014-04-22T21:50:09  <superbee> note that each ref under refs/meta/dashboards/ creates a section at https://review-dev.openstack.org/#/admin/projects/All-Projects,dashboards and each file in that ref creates a listing under that section
2014-04-22T21:50:28  <superbee> so we probably want a single ref we use, then add different files to that ref if we want more than one dashboard

2014-04-22T21:54:26  <jbooboo> superbee, zaro: so the navigation path for that is... "projects->list->all projects->(projects)->dashboards->important changes", right?

2014-04-22T22:12:29  <sweston> correct?
2014-04-22T22:12:34  <anteaya> so what will happen is that we will be prompted to add the new gerrit host ssh key to our known_hosts file?

2014-04-22T22:15:36  <mordred> I've got a change prepared to move our current paste to cloud db

2014-04-22T22:15:50  <mordred> provisioned by trov
2014-04-22T22:15:57  <mordred> just havent' gotten around to ityet
2014-04-22T22:16:00  * anteaya nods
2014-04-22T22:16:43  <jbooboo> anteaya: revised last section
2014-04-22T22:16:49  <mrodden> jbooboo: if i move it to openstack-dev/bash8, do the ACL entries that are in the current patchset still make sense?
2014-04-22T22:16:51  <mordred> there's no real reason that our current paste should be slow ... oh, except there is no buffer pool configured

2014-04-22T22:17:28  <mordred> notmyname: I'd be fine running not-lodgeit for pastebin and backing it with swift for sure
2014-04-22T22:17:32  <jbooboo> anteaya: i don't think that's necessarily true
2014-04-22T22:17:42  <mordred> superbee: well, by "fix it" first I mean" move it to trove"
2014-04-22T22:17:57  <jbooboo> anteaya: i'd like to leave the process documentation for when we actually have it.
2014-04-22T22:18:33  <notmyname> hmm...when is launchpad openid going to be replaced by an openstack-infra managed keystone deployment?
2014-04-22T22:18:42  <anteaya> jbooboo: okay I will remove what I added
2014-04-22T22:18:59  <superbee> I don't think it will be keystone
2014-04-22T22:19:02  <jbooboo> notmyname: when web apps start accepting keystone tokens?
2014-04-22T22:19:19  <notmyname> jbooboo: your new, fancy trove-provisioned pastebin!
2014-04-22T22:19:25  <notmyname> jbooboo: and storyboard!
2014-04-22T22:19:33  <notmyname> jbooboo: and gerrit
2014-04-22T22:19:40  <jbooboo> notmyname: we're not writing a pastebin
2014-04-22T22:19:54  <mordred> notmyname: are you volunteering to write a patch to gerrit to make it consume keystone tokens? neat!
2014-04-22T22:20:05  <notmyname> lol. I was half trolling about the keystone idea (although I think it would be an interesting excercize)
2014-04-22T22:20:24  <notmyname> pastebin, on the other hand, is kinda painful today
2014-04-22T22:20:53  <jbooboo> notmyname: infra runs what people show up and do, so if mordred fixes the pastebin, that's cool, or if someone shows up with a patch to replace it with the swift thing, that's cool
2014-04-22T22:20:59  <notmyname> mordred: when I was at RAX, we had the rule that if someone claimed something were easy, it meant that person automatically volunteered to code it
2014-04-22T22:21:14  <jbooboo> notmyname: the foundation did hire some folks to write an openid provider so we can move off of launchpad

2014-04-22T22:35:46  <anteaya> okay if it is that easy
2014-04-22T22:35:48  <jbooboo> or, i believe in your case, perhaps just "ask your employer to add you to the list of people on the corporate cla"

2014-04-22T23:08:02  * devananda wonders when jogo will add a spelling-and-grammar-module to hacking
2014-04-22T23:08:29  <zaro> anteaya: also did you add file and commit?
2014-04-22T23:09:00  <sdague> devananda: that was vetoed :)
2014-04-22T23:09:14  <jogo> devananda: I thought about adding spelling, but grammar is harder
2014-04-22T23:09:22  <devananda> hehe
2014-04-22T23:09:25  <devananda> i was sorta kidding
2014-04-22T23:09:42  <sdague> jogo: people just need to turn on spell checking in their editors if they care
2014-04-22T23:09:42  <jbooboo> jogo was not, which is scary.  :)

2014-04-22T23:15:02  <zaro> anteaya: you should see instructions on your push attempt to run a command to allow gerrit to create a change id.

2014-04-22T23:15:39  <superbee> you have to install the hook
2014-04-22T23:15:40  <zaro> anteaya: git-review does it automatically.

2014-04-22T23:30:50  <anteaya> reverify no bug was
2014-04-22T23:30:59  <anteaya> but it works if you have a bug number
2014-04-22T23:31:25  <zaro> anteaya: thanks.

2014-04-22T23:33:31  <superbee> it has a slightly lower than 1 fail per hour rate last I checked
2014-04-22T23:33:42  <superbee> ~35 failures over 48 hours when I looked
2014-04-22T23:34:32  <zaro> superbee: it's been approved, but can't run 'reverify no bug', so what to do?
2014-04-22T23:34:44  <superbee> zaro: recheck it or reapprove it
2014-04-22T23:34:52  <superbee> or find the bug and use that number
2014-04-22T23:34:55  <superbee> which is ideal
