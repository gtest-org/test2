2014-04-29T00:38:08  <mordred> the learning curve was "what sequence do these thigns run in, which run in the image and which run outside, and what paths are pre-set in env vars"
2014-04-29T00:38:20  <fungi> the basic takeaway is that you need a minimal but syntactically correct nugget of gerrit acl config *and* groups file written to disk with the gerrit service not yet started, enough to allow project-bootstrappers to push the rest through the api

2014-04-29T01:29:22  <jeblair> mordred: ok.  i'm assuming that something about the html changed -- the test report beautification actually matches the transformed html output that gerrit produces for list items

2014-04-29T02:05:45  <fungi> mordred: that makes sense actually. i noticed that links in gerrit 2.8 now open in a new target rather than in the current window/tab
2014-04-29T02:06:02  <mordred> fungi: I mean, it's not that destructive - we _could_ just apply it and restart gerrit and see if it fixes it
2014-04-29T02:06:18  <fungi> it's possible to test on review-dev it we want
2014-04-29T02:07:03  <fungi> not so much testing the puppetry, but manually adjusting the gerrit.config in a corresponding manner
2014-04-29T02:07:10  <mordred> fungi: how do we get text in there to test ?

2014-04-29T10:19:58  <Adri2000> at https://review.openstack.org/#/c/89534/ why did jenkins decide it would recheck (and do nothing afterwards)?
2014-04-29T10:20:07  <Adri2000> is it a consequence of the gerrit upgrade?

2014-04-29T13:03:15  <fungi> oh, i see. mordred had target before href when gerrit was printing it after instead
2014-04-29T13:03:46  <SergeyLukjanov> fungi, exactly
2014-04-29T13:03:55  <fungi> i was too bleary-eyed to see straight by that point last night and missed it entirely
2014-04-29T13:04:02  <SergeyLukjanov> fungi, I've updated the CR and approved it
2014-04-29T13:04:24  <SergeyLukjanov> fungi, and only after it merged I remember that we need to restart gerrit to apply it
2014-04-29T13:04:56  <fungi> great! but yeah, it takes a gerrit restart to apply configuration changes, and since this is a cosmetic fix we may want to wait a little and batch it up with other fixes we may need to restart for anyway
2014-04-29T13:05:31  <SergeyLukjanov> fungi, sure
2014-04-29T13:06:00  <BobBall> Any chance you could workflow+1 https://review.openstack.org/#/c/90660/ again fungi?  You did so yesterday but then I guess something got restarted, so the job was lost

2014-04-29T13:09:50  <sdague> though it doesn't seem like it's taking the additional approve
2014-04-29T13:10:04  <sdague> fungi: I guess we are missing a trigger?
2014-04-29T13:11:00  <sdague> BobBall: so actually, because we were within clean check, you actually just needed a recheck no bug to get jenkins to pay attention to it
2014-04-29T13:11:06  <fungi> i added a +1 workflow to all the previously approved changes after the upgrade, adding myself to the project bootstrappers group so i'd have the necessary permissions, but when i removed myself from that group again afterward it also made my vote disappear since i no longer had permission
2014-04-29T13:11:17  <fungi> then adding myself back to that group, it appears again
2014-04-29T13:11:25  <fungi> the way gerrit applies acls is very, very bizarre

2014-04-29T14:43:41  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, and https://review.openstack.org/#/c/91013/1 is just a possible improvement
2014-04-29T14:43:50  <sdague> for instance - https://review.openstack.org/#/projects/openstack-dev/grenade,dashboards/important-changes:important-changes-dashboard

2014-04-29T14:44:39  <jeblair> sdague: yeah, that's just grenade inheriting the ability to display the important changes dashboard because it is a child of all-projects
2014-04-29T14:44:41  *** markmcclain has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-29T14:44:59  <sdague> jeblair: right, but doesn't filter based on the project
2014-04-29T14:45:05  <jeblair> sdague: if grenade had a grenade-specific dashboard, it would be available at https://review.openstack.org/#/projects/openstack-dev/grenade,dashboards/important-changes:foo
2014-04-29T14:45:21  <jeblair> sdague: but would not be available at https://review.openstack.org/#/projects/openstack-dev/somethingnotgrenade,dashboards/important-changes:foo
2014-04-29T14:45:42  <jeblair> sdague: yeah, and afaik (but i haven't really looked) there's no way to use $current_project_url_context as a search variable

2014-04-29T14:56:09  <fungi> browsers implement ways for users to control whether links open in the same place or a new window/tab/whatever. having the application decide that for you is silly
2014-04-29T14:56:22  <fungi> and disruptive
2014-04-29T14:56:51  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, I mean that if we're adding target=_blank than link will be opened in new tab on click

2014-04-29T16:16:48  <mordred> phschwartz: so from rax perspective, those could look like "success"

2014-04-29T16:18:47  <mordred> fungi: hpcloud-region-b nodes are mostly over 200 hours old
2014-04-29T16:19:13  <mordred> fungi: actually ALL of hp images are - 1.0 regions are in the 400 hours range
2014-04-29T16:19:15  <fungi> oh, right, i deleted them all out of rax yesterday since they were broken, so these failures in rax-dfw very well may not be our doing

2014-04-29T17:45:44  <jeblair> mordred: i should have known there would be an error because no error was reported to puppetdb and that is how we tell there's an error.
2014-04-29T17:45:49  <mordred> yah
2014-04-29T17:46:12  <jeblair> mordred: istr that we found that some things were not making it to puppetdb, and no one could figure out why.

2014-04-29T18:26:44  <zaro> phschwartz, jeblair : this one as well because it updates how the config file gets loaded. https://review.openstack.org/#/c/52080
2014-04-29T18:27:01  <mordred> zaro, phschwartz that LOOKS like would wind up with ignore_cache being false in most cases appropriately
2014-04-29T18:27:02  <jeblair> zaro: we don't set that, and it looks like it defaults to false
2014-04-29T18:27:04  <zaro> that one merged just last week.
2014-04-29T18:27:52  <phschwartz> Yeah, after just stepping through a jjb run in pdb, it is set to false and it is trying to load the cache so I am even more stumped.

2014-04-29T18:33:14  <phschwartz> ok, so now I can see after a few tests. My issue was purely due to dir perms where my user couldn't write to the dir. It is working from cache with no issue after the perms fix.

2014-04-29T20:25:15  <openstackgerrit> James E. Blair proposed a change to openstack-infra/config: Drop the ref from the tag fetch in GGP  https://review.openstack.org/91164
2014-04-29T20:25:17  <ArxCruz> jeblair: okay, thanks
2014-04-29T20:25:26  <jeblair> mordred, fungi: ^ that should take care of the tag problem
2014-04-29T20:25:28  <anteaya> asselin__: so in the backscroll jeblair encountered an issue with a newline in a key, he wrapped the value in strip() to remove it, I don't think there was a patch
2014-04-29T20:25:37  <anteaya> asselin__: but I could be wrong
2014-04-29T20:25:48  <fungi> okay, well i seem to be able to rebuild bare-centos6 images successfully now, and the count seems to be better distributed across providers again
2014-04-29T20:26:12  <jeblair> mordred, fungi: the problem likely occurred only while we were having replication issues.  the fix above will make it so that it should work regardless of replication status
2014-04-29T20:26:43  <jeblair> mordred, fungi: moreover, i think very rarely we have seen that failure in normal operation -- those cases were likely replication delays which this should fix
2014-04-29T20:27:00  <jeblair> mordred, fungi: (i tested by cloning a copy of sandbox from the old gerrit server; that was helpful)
2014-04-29T20:27:23  <anteaya> asselin__: http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/%23openstack-infra/%23openstack-infra.2014-04-29.log timestamp 2014-04-29T16:58:26
2014-04-29T20:27:29  <jeblair> fungi: what was the contos problem?
2014-04-29T20:27:55  <fungi> jeblair: oh, that's a tricky one. so if you fetch a specific tag it needs to be one your remote update found, but if you fetch all tags it will get them even when remote update failed?
2014-04-29T20:28:07  <jeblair> fungi: (btw, i think you and i are the only cores around if you want to go aheand and aprv https://review.openstack.org/91164)
2014-04-29T20:28:18  <jeblair> fungi: even better -- it only fails the first time.  a subsequent fetch will work
2014-04-29T20:28:29  <ArxCruz> jeblair: so gerrit: { } means post a message failing or not, but don't vote ?
2014-04-29T20:28:32  <jeblair> fungi: (because the first fetch got the info needed for the second fetch to work)

2014-04-29T20:28:52  <fungi> jeblair: the centos6 image build issue was curl not following the github redirect to the new url, so that outstanding patch definitely solved it
2014-04-29T20:29:08  <asselin__> anteaya, thanks...not sure if it's the same...but I will try it
2014-04-29T20:29:14  <jeblair> fungi: what caused the 70 building/deleting nodes?

2014-04-29T20:30:00  <fungi> jeblair: that i'm less sure about. from the logs it looked like we were timing out ssh access to them in hpclolud-region-b and it was going into a tight rebuild loop

2014-04-29T20:34:35  <anteaya> SlickNik: what was the issue?
2014-04-29T20:34:48  <SlickNik> fungi / anteaya: The deprecated 'approve' alias for the 'review' SSH command has been removed as of gerrit 2.8.
2014-04-29T20:35:00  <SlickNik> And gerrit trigger plugin was using this alias.
2014-04-29T20:35:12  <anteaya> how did you fix it?
2014-04-29T20:35:12  <asselin__> fungi, mordred do you know the reason why that change is needed? i.e. a change in puppet?
2014-04-29T20:35:13  <SlickNik> (by default)
2014-04-29T20:35:25  <anteaya> SlickNik: just remove the alias?
2014-04-29T20:35:44  <SlickNik> THey let you override the commands in the  global configuration for the plugin though.
2014-04-29T20:36:01  <anteaya> SlickNik: oh you changed it there, cool
2014-04-29T20:36:03  <SlickNik> So I just changed the commands to use 'review' instead of 'approve'
2014-04-29T20:36:08  <anteaya> cool
2014-04-29T20:36:11  <SlickNik> Yup, that seems to be working well.
2014-04-29T20:36:14  <anteaya> thanks for letting us know
2014-04-29T20:36:33  <anteaya> your's won't be the last system tripping on this

2014-04-29T20:37:13  <SlickNik> Not a problem. Now you know. :)
2014-04-29T20:37:37  <SlickNik> FYI: The release notes that talk about the removal of the deprecated 'approve' alias - https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotes-2.8.html
2014-04-29T20:38:08  <fungi> asselin__: to support being able to run puppet agent on demand via ssh from the master we implemented the ssh_authorized_key type, so that change started using it everywhere for consistency

2014-04-29T20:40:06  <asselin__> fungi, ok so perhaps that broke the instructions in nodepool readme: export NODEPOOL_SSH_KEY=`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
2014-04-29T20:40:43  <anteaya> SlickNik: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GerritUpgrade#Gerrit_Trigger_Plugin
2014-04-29T20:40:47  <asselin__> fungi, since the public key can have spaces...I'll take a look and see if that is it
2014-04-29T20:40:52  <anteaya> SlickNik: do add anything you think is missing
2014-04-29T20:40:52  <mordred> asselin__: aha!
2014-04-29T20:41:12  <mordred> asselin__: let me go look ... it's possible we broke that
2014-04-29T20:41:37  <asselin__> mordred, thanks!
2014-04-29T20:42:11  <SlickNik> anteaya: Thanks! That looks good.
2014-04-29T20:42:12  <anteaya> ArxCruz had posted to the infra ml about changing the host key: http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-infra/2014-April/001201.html
2014-04-29T20:42:17  <anteaya> SlickNik: thanks
2014-04-29T20:42:34  <fungi> asselin__: as a workaround, you might try switching to NODEPOOL_SSH_KEY=`cut -d' ' -f-2 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

2014-04-29T20:42:54  <mordred> fungi: I think we might want to do that in prepare_node.sh
2014-04-29T20:43:21  <fungi> mordred: we probably need to split it there and pass in the separate vars, agreed
2014-04-29T20:45:42  <mordred> fungi: we could test to see if the ssh key string has ssh-rsa in it, and if so , split it
2014-04-29T20:46:41  <mordred> jeblair: so - apparently we've grown instances of gliffy, the code review cuckoo?

2014-04-29T20:52:50  <mordred> sdague: those look like good things
2014-04-29T20:52:53  <sdague> so then if you applied it to nova, you'd only get nova code, for instance
2014-04-29T20:52:57  <anteaya> sdague: do you care that I think that?

2014-04-29T20:54:26  <mordred> so - right now, important changes is a file called "important-changes-dashboard" in the ref refs/dashboards/important-changes on All-Projects
2014-04-29T20:54:57  <anteaya> adrift, lacking, astray, wayward
2014-04-29T20:55:08  <anteaya> I love a trip to the thesaurus
2014-04-29T20:55:21  <anteaya> like any of them?
2014-04-29T20:55:25  <mordred> which is to say - any dashboard needs a category (refs/dashboards/important-changes) and a name "important-changes-dashboard"
2014-04-29T20:55:51  <mordred> I'm not 100% sure how to delete a dashboard ref, btw
2014-04-29T20:55:59  <mordred> but inside of that t's just files

2014-04-29T20:56:40  <mordred> for testing, since deleting a file is easy - I could push a new additional file to the important-changes ref ?

2014-04-29T20:57:04  <fungi> mordred: might be able to push a null ref to it. doesn't look like the ui treats those as actual branches though
2014-04-29T20:57:19  <sdague> so if we do it badly it can be wiped out

2014-04-29T20:57:29  <mordred> that's my main concern right now
2014-04-29T20:58:04  <sdague> also, who has permissions to do refs/ manip? is that just the manage-projects script?
2014-04-29T20:58:11  <jeblair> sdague, mordred: i think as long as sdague's queries are going in a different file, the foreach should be fine -- if they get combined with the existing important changes dashboard file, i think the project token needs to distribute down to those 3 queries and the foreach should be removed
2014-04-29T20:58:20  <fungi> mordred: since it looks like a branchish ref in git, and it's possible to push :remotename to delete branches, i'd say it's worth trying on review-dev
2014-04-29T20:58:20  <mordred> and project bootstrappers
2014-04-29T20:58:28  <sdague> jeblair: yeh, I think this should be a different file

2014-04-29T23:14:49  <derekh> fungi: thanks for merging the F20 nodes, looks like they are failing to build at the very end in restrict_memory,sh
2014-04-29T23:15:13  <derekh> fungi: so how would you feel about skipping it until I find a proper alternative ? ^
2014-04-29T23:16:00  <fungi> derekh: yeah, i see where it's mainly failing trying to run update-grub in restrict_memory.sh
2014-04-29T23:16:37  <fungi> derekh: ideas on how to adjust the kernel command line in f20?

2014-04-29T23:18:22  <derekh> fungi: ok, I'm trying to figure out how that image got the legacy grub config file in the first place, the one I am testing on has /boot/grub/grub.conf
2014-04-29T23:18:57  <fungi> derekh: hmm... perhaps it has both?
2014-04-29T23:19:17  *** alexpilotti has joined #openstack-infra
2014-04-29T23:19:21  <fungi> an old (but unused) /etc/default/grub file and also a /boot/grub/grub.conf?
2014-04-29T23:19:49  <fungi> if so, then maybe merely swapping the order in that conditional would suffice
2014-04-29T23:20:35  <fungi> i assume /etc/default/grub is merely being used here to directly modify grub 1.x /boot/grub/menu.lst files
2014-04-29T23:21:36  <derekh> fungi: perhaps, its not present on the default fedora cloud image, I'll see if I can figure out where it is coming from
