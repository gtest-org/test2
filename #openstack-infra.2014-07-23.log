2014-07-23T11:52:22  <bauzas> hi folks, I got 2 questions for you
2014-07-23T11:53:09  <bauzas> turbo-hipster seems to be in a bad shape, because it has a false positive on https://review.openstack.org/82778 , and 'recheck migrations' haven't yet done
2014-07-23T11:53:22  <bauzas> so I'm wondering how I can help
2014-07-23T11:53:46  <bauzas> and how I can check if turbo-hipster noticed it has to review again a patch

2014-07-23T11:56:52  <jhesketh> I don't think so, but thanks
2014-07-23T11:56:59  <bauzas> jhesketh: sure
2014-07-23T11:57:06  <jhesketh> it seems like our zuul is failing to listen to gerrit which is why it missed the recheck
2014-07-23T11:57:18  <bauzas> jhesketh: oh right
2014-07-23T11:57:20  *** p5ntangl_ has quit IRC

2014-07-23T12:03:27  <sdague> bauzas: honestly, you don't, that's a terrible way to do this
2014-07-23T12:03:28  *** eglynn has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-23T12:03:29  <bauzas> sdague: because we need to track NFV blueprints
2014-07-23T12:04:04  <bauzas> sdague: so we scratch from a wiki a list of bps, then get the review IDs
2014-07-23T12:04:30  *** p5ntangle has quit IRC
2014-07-23T12:04:38  <bauzas> sdague: so I'm just wondering how to achieve this, because the NFV subteam is working on nova, neutron and cinder

2014-07-23T12:04:57  *** p5ntangl_ has quit IRC

2014-07-23T12:05:42  *** k4n0 has quit IRC
2014-07-23T12:05:43  <sdague> then their reviews get missed :)
2014-07-23T12:05:49  <bauzas> sdague: we have some new contributors here
2014-07-23T12:05:52  <sdague> sure
2014-07-23T12:06:08  <sdague> but this solution of iterating over all the reviews isn't going to work
2014-07-23T12:06:16  <sdague> as you've seen
2014-07-23T12:06:21  <bauzas> sdague: and sometimes the commit message is containing the word 'blueprint' so that sucks the topic name
2014-07-23T12:06:35  <sdague> bauzas: right, so train them to do it right
2014-07-23T12:06:47  <sdague> because if they don't, their reviews will get missed
2014-07-23T12:06:50  <bauzas> sdague: it was my first intention :-)
2014-07-23T12:06:58  <sdague> it seems like enough incentive for people to do the right thing
2014-07-23T12:07:09  <bauzas> sdague: well, makes sense, will speak about that on our next meeting today
2014-07-23T12:07:53  <bauzas> sdague: but I'm unsure it will reduce dramatically the URI length, as 1 BP == 1 patch atm
2014-07-23T12:08:07  <sdague> bauzas: really?
2014-07-23T12:08:15  *** jgallard has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-23T12:08:15  <sdague> that seems like entirely the wrong granularity
2014-07-23T12:08:18  <bauzas> sdague: yeah that sucks, you know
2014-07-23T12:08:33  <sdague> how many blueprints do you think you are going to land in the next 4 weeks?
2014-07-23T12:08:46  *** Guest13108 has joined #openstack-infra

2014-07-23T12:09:37  <bauzas> sdague: but I agree, now the Spec freeze arrived, there are a few less blueprints to track

2014-07-23T12:10:18  <bauzas> sdague: anyway, thanks for the help, will need to open a discussion in the nfv meeting :)

2014-07-23T12:10:38  *** p5ntangl_ has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-23T12:11:06  <sdague> so are you trying to use this for a status dashboard, or actually for real time review todo list?
2014-07-23T12:11:17  <sdague> because if the later, I'd actually not do it this way at all
2014-07-23T12:12:23  <bauzas> sdague: can I say both ? :)
2014-07-23T12:12:43  <sdague> they are different use cases though, gerrit's a pretty terrible status ui
2014-07-23T12:12:47  *** p5ntangle has quit IRC
2014-07-23T12:12:49  <bauzas> sdague: we have PMs who track the status
2014-07-23T12:13:04  <sdague> right, so build a dashboard for that
2014-07-23T12:13:09  <sdague> not a gerrit one
2014-07-23T12:13:10  <bauzas> sdague: but we also have reviewers (like me) who check this dashboard

2014-07-23T12:14:58  *** pdmars has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-23T12:15:35  <bauzas> sdague: that sounds a good alternative, but not that precise as we only have one query per project IIUC
2014-07-23T12:16:10  <bauzas> sdague: we liked custom dashboard for the possibility to segregate queries
2014-07-23T12:16:25  <bauzas> sdague: like WIPs, need second +2, etc.
2014-07-23T12:16:53  <bauzas> sdague: but anyway, will contribute to it, yes
2014-07-23T12:16:57  <sdague> sure, the point is you can do that in an offline way as well
2014-07-23T12:17:02  <bauzas> sdague: because that's anotherview
2014-07-23T12:17:14  <sdague> because as you've seen, you can't do what you want to do with gerrit js
2014-07-23T12:17:27  <bauzas> ok, will RTFM reviewday then :)
2014-07-23T12:17:40  <bauzas> yeah, sounds cool indeed

2014-07-23T15:12:25  <devananda> i'm probably doing someting wrong with logstash again -- is there a reason it isn't indexing gate-tempest-dsvm-virtual-ironic logs/screen-n-sched.txt?

2014-07-23T17:23:38  <vermarah_> I'm trying to set up comment rechecks with Zuul on a third party CI system. As a first test I add a line "-event: comment-added" to the trigger section of my layout.yaml and then added a comment to a patch I had uploaded earlier. This caused Jenkins to repeatedly test my patch, inform me that it suceeded, and then start testing again. This went on until I killed zuul and jenkins. Any idea why zuul would make jenkins loop like that?

2014-07-23T17:25:06  <zaro> anteaya: you probably don't need to change http password, but it's available.  the http password allows users to use the gerrit REST api which i don't think 3rd party need.

2014-07-23T19:57:47  <krotscheck> There are really only two good options to fix it. The first is to see whether gerrit has cors support somewhere (I don’t know if it does). The second is to proxy all requests through your server using something like mod_proxy.

2014-07-23T20:01:30  <sdague> ok, just realize I'm going to -2 this approach, the page load time is already unacceptable for the ER page, and going off and real time hitting gerrit with a ton of rest requests isn't something we should do

2014-07-23T20:02:41  <krotscheck> I believe that newer versions of tomcat come with a CORS servlet filter that you just have to enable & configure.
2014-07-23T20:02:55  <krotscheck> But if sdague is just going to -2 that then there’s no real point.
2014-07-23T20:03:09  <krotscheck> Plus I don’t really know how gerrit is deployed, I’m still sifting through those manifests.

2014-07-23T23:39:39  <dougwig> pleia2: 4 works reasonably well.  it's steady state using about 300mb of swap, so if you've got a VM with no swap, you need to plumb in a swapfile, which is less than ideal i/o.  but it's not godawful failure and pain like 2.
