2014-07-28T09:50:00  <kashyap> izinovik, If you're facing issues w/ current git, then #openstack-nova is the right place, if you're facing issues with current stable release (IceHouse), then probably ask.openstack.org

2014-07-28T12:05:15  <anteaya> hi joa and krtaylor
2014-07-28T12:05:23  <_dguerri> Hello there. anteaya told me that she want to discuss this review https://review.openstack.org/109292 (inclusion of git-upstream in stackforge) during the next infra meeting. Who can add this topic to the agenda, please?
2014-07-28T12:05:27  <anteaya> krtaylor: so do you have time to talk about december?
2014-07-28T12:05:37  <anteaya> _dguerri: you can
2014-07-28T12:05:41  *** dkranz has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T12:05:48  <_dguerri> oh, really... cool :)
2014-07-28T12:05:50  <_dguerri> will do then

2014-07-28T12:06:07  <krtaylor> hi anteaya
2014-07-28T12:06:31  <anteaya> hi krtaylor
2014-07-28T12:06:41  <anteaya> running away to a meeting or do you have a few?
2014-07-28T12:06:47  <krtaylor> anteaya, sure, for a little bit, warning - I am caffeine depleted
2014-07-28T12:06:51  <anteaya> np
2014-07-28T12:06:57  <anteaya> so december
2014-07-28T12:07:07  <anteaya> what things do we want to accomplish?
2014-07-28T12:07:27  <anteaya> one item is a face to face with third party ci admins so they can meet each other
2014-07-28T12:07:33  <anteaya> and teach each other
2014-07-28T12:07:35  *** hashar has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T12:07:38  <anteaya> tutorial style
2014-07-28T12:08:04  <krtaylor> anteaya, its hard for me to think past summit, but yes
2014-07-28T12:08:04  <anteaya> also clarkb had a good suggestion to open it up for more general automated testing topics
2014-07-28T12:08:11  <anteaya> and draw in other folks
2014-07-28T12:08:30  <anteaya> well we have to get something figured out for there to be an event
2014-07-28T12:08:37  <anteaya> else it disappears
2014-07-28T12:08:50  <anteaya> what do you want to accomplish?
2014-07-28T12:08:58  <krtaylor> anteaya, I think some way for summaries of systems to be shared by those that cannot attend would be good  define
2014-07-28T12:09:11  <dguerri> anteaya thanks. just added it
2014-07-28T12:09:26  <anteaya> dguerri: great thanks
2014-07-28T12:09:44  <anteaya> krtaylor: how is that different from what we have now?
2014-07-28T12:09:48  <krtaylor> anteaya,  well, I was thinking it could be joint infra/thirdparty, we'll need infra there to get anything done
2014-07-28T12:10:05  <anteaya> it would be good to have as much of infra as can attend
2014-07-28T12:10:19  <anteaya> I disagree we need infra there to get anything done
2014-07-28T12:10:25  <krtaylor> anteaya, what we have now could work, the systems pages could be that framework, if it was used that way
2014-07-28T12:10:34  <anteaya> I think the folks attending third party meetings are getting a lot done
2014-07-28T12:10:52  <anteaya> let's work towards using that way
2014-07-28T12:10:54  <krtaylor> absolutely, not what I meant
2014-07-28T12:11:12  <anteaya> I want infra there, but I don't want the success of the event to be defined by jim's schedule for instance
2014-07-28T12:11:14  <krtaylor> also infra work
2014-07-28T12:11:23  <anteaya> since we haven't asked him what he wants yet
2014-07-28T12:11:26  <anteaya> right
2014-07-28T12:11:38  <anteaya> we can have some code sprint type work done
2014-07-28T12:11:48  <anteaya> like on pulling out a module or somethign
2014-07-28T12:13:07  <krtaylor> yes, I want more work on post summit decisions on jenkins, testing, storyboard, etc
2014-07-28T12:13:19  <krtaylor> not just third party focused
2014-07-28T12:13:26  <anteaya> sounds good
2014-07-28T12:13:36  <anteaya> I don't know about storyboard
2014-07-28T12:13:38  <krtaylor> like just happened
2014-07-28T12:13:46  <anteaya> that would be tough to pull off
2014-07-28T12:13:55  <anteaya> sounds like you want an infra meetup
2014-07-28T12:13:55  <krtaylor> whys that
2014-07-28T12:14:01  *** dtantsur has quit IRC
2014-07-28T12:14:26  <krtaylor> yes, with ci improvement as the focus
2014-07-28T12:14:41  <krtaylor> and other things, but primarily CI
2014-07-28T12:15:09  <krtaylor> I think the meetup/sharing event needs to happen at summit
2014-07-28T12:15:11  *** sandywalsh has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T12:15:34  <krtaylor> it will be hard for someone with a limited travel budget to attend both
2014-07-28T12:15:38  <anteaya> I think we are not at all on the same page
2014-07-28T12:15:49  *** lttrl has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T12:15:59  <anteaya> what just took place in darmstadt was a qa/infra meetup
2014-07-28T12:16:06  <anteaya> that is not what I want this event to be
2014-07-28T12:16:29  <anteaya> I want this event to be a chance for third party people to meet and learn from other thrid party people
2014-07-28T12:16:48  <anteaya> since there seems to be some myth than they can only do things once someone has blessed them
2014-07-28T12:16:56  <anteaya> and I need to dispell that myth
2014-07-28T12:17:10  <anteaya> there are many things third party folks can do to self regulate
2014-07-28T12:17:14  <anteaya> and teach each other
2014-07-28T12:17:33  <anteaya> and offer patches to code and documents that would improve their experience
2014-07-28T12:17:34  *** ArxCruz has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T12:17:40  <krtaylor> absolutely, thats why I wanted to form this group
2014-07-28T12:17:43  <anteaya> that is what I would like to focus on
2014-07-28T12:17:55  <anteaya> that is what I would like us to discuss
2014-07-28T12:18:03  <krtaylor> but I don't think it would work as a mid-cycle
2014-07-28T12:18:09  *** yamamoto has quit IRC
2014-07-28T12:18:13  <anteaya> it isn't a mid-cycle
2014-07-28T12:18:20  <anteaya> this is a third party meetup
2014-07-28T12:18:24  *** jcoufal has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T12:18:42  <anteaya> expanded to include other folks interested in automated testing and quality frameworks
2014-07-28T12:18:53  <anteaya> some of which may have nothing to do with openstack
2014-07-28T12:18:56  <krtaylor> then why not at summit with better attendance?
2014-07-28T12:19:03  <krtaylor> oh, not OS, hm
2014-07-28T12:19:10  <anteaya> openstack is openstack
2014-07-28T12:19:16  <anteaya> OS is operating system
2014-07-28T12:19:26  <krtaylor> heh, with more coffee it is
2014-07-28T12:19:28  <anteaya> because I have no time at summit
2014-07-28T12:19:38  <anteaya> and noone else in infra has time at summit
2014-07-28T12:19:47  <anteaya> and summit is already planned
2014-07-28T12:19:58  <anteaya> we can't plan an event to take place at summit now
2014-07-28T12:20:06  <anteaya> we have no space in the schedule and no rooms
2014-07-28T12:20:16  <anteaya> summit planning took place long ago
2014-07-28T12:20:26  <anteaya> we can't just add events to summit
2014-07-28T12:20:31  <krtaylor> ok, thats why I was wondering
2014-07-28T12:20:50  <anteaya> good thing we are talking
2014-07-28T12:21:04  *** mbacchi has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T12:21:16  <krtaylor> I doubt all sessions are planned, but I agree that space has been allocated
2014-07-28T12:21:22  <anteaya> so we need an event for third party folks to meet and talk to and learn from other third party and automated testing folks
2014-07-28T12:21:39  <anteaya> the time for sessions has been allocated
2014-07-28T12:22:03  <krtaylor> last summit, I was trying to organize a meetup where we used some common area, it turned out to be the dev lounge, so it wouldnt have worked anyway
2014-07-28T12:22:36  <anteaya> the most you can do at summit is gather some folks for drinks, informally
2014-07-28T12:22:54  <anteaya> since formal events are by lottery under the organization of the foundation
2014-07-28T12:23:03  <krtaylor> anteaya, ok, I am beginning to understand your vision, and I agree it is needed, what I saw all along too
2014-07-28T12:23:12  <anteaya> so let's consider summit unavailable for this kind of event
2014-07-28T12:23:16  <anteaya> great
2014-07-28T12:23:18  <krtaylor> I just see some problems getting good attendance
2014-07-28T12:23:19  <anteaya> so Austin
2014-07-28T12:23:29  <anteaya> it depends on what we are offering
2014-07-28T12:23:46  <anteaya> and I'm curious to know what you mean by good attendance
2014-07-28T12:23:55  <krtaylor> anteaya, I have sent out the request through the proper channels, should know soon
2014-07-28T12:24:04  <anteaya> I see 30 - 50 being no problem at all
2014-07-28T12:24:13  <anteaya> krtaylor: okay thanks, keep me informed
2014-07-28T12:24:18  *** nelsnelson has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T12:24:24  <krtaylor> really, my last event, we didnt break 20
2014-07-28T12:24:29  <anteaya> since it if takes too long or the answer is no, we have to come up with a back up plan
2014-07-28T12:24:35  <anteaya> krtaylor: which event was that?
2014-07-28T12:24:40  <krtaylor> although it was tight focused, and planned last minute
2014-07-28T12:25:02  <anteaya> I think the planned last minute might be the key there
2014-07-28T12:25:38  <krtaylor> anteaya, agreed, it might not be a bad idea to see about a second location as a backup
2014-07-28T12:25:57  <anteaya> okay I put out some feelers already and can follow up with an email
2014-07-28T12:26:08  * krtaylor notices his empty coffee cup
2014-07-28T12:26:14  <anteaya> what event was the last event to which you are refering?

2014-07-28T12:27:25  <krtaylor> I organized a Linux/Android multimedia mini-summit in Austin on our campus, I was the Linaro multimedia tech lead at that time

2014-07-28T12:28:03  <krtaylor> anteaya, nope, not even close
2014-07-28T12:28:08  <anteaya> so yay for getting 20 people
2014-07-28T12:28:10  <anteaya> well done
2014-07-28T12:28:22  *** pdmars has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T12:28:30  <yolanda> anteaya, thx, i think formatting is fine now, but i'd like to have some feedback about topics
2014-07-28T12:28:51  <anteaya> so since I have zero plans to set up an entity to collect admission fees, let's just agree to make the event fee-less
2014-07-28T12:29:13  <anteaya> we get someone to pay for the room at a hotel and we ensure the hotel is close to restaurants
2014-07-28T12:29:42  * krtaylor isn't sure but that he may have just been insulted on his summit marketing skillz  :)
2014-07-28T12:29:44  <anteaya> and then attendees do their own rooms and food and we get someone to cover the cost of the meeting room and av needs
2014-07-28T12:29:54  <anteaya> krtaylor: not at all
2014-07-28T12:30:02  <anteaya> I was complimenting you

2014-07-28T12:30:05  <krtaylor> anteaya, agreed, no registration
2014-07-28T12:30:13  <anteaya> no we need registration
2014-07-28T12:30:15  <krtaylor> anteaya, it would be IBM sponsored
2014-07-28T12:30:19  <anteaya> what we don't need is fees
2014-07-28T12:30:21  <krtaylor> right no fee
2014-07-28T12:30:24  <anteaya> well good
2014-07-28T12:30:37  <krtaylor> they would have to pay to get there and lodging
2014-07-28T12:30:40  <anteaya> let's get an email saying IBM will cover the room at a hotel and av needs
2014-07-28T12:30:51  <anteaya> then we will acknowledge them as sponsor
2014-07-28T12:30:55  <krtaylor> no, on campus
2014-07-28T12:31:13  <anteaya> hmmmmm
2014-07-28T12:31:21  <krtaylor> thats the only way we could do it
2014-07-28T12:31:26  <anteaya> really?
2014-07-28T12:31:49  <krtaylor> yeah, room/av is "free" that way
2014-07-28T12:31:49  <anteaya> well what kinds of food options are available on IBM campus?
2014-07-28T12:32:14  <krtaylor> we have full catering from our on-site cafeteria
2014-07-28T12:32:28  <anteaya> by attendees will have to pay our ot pocket
2014-07-28T12:32:34  <krtaylor> and restaurants close
2014-07-28T12:32:36  <anteaya> what choices will attendees have
2014-07-28T12:32:43  <anteaya> how close for restaurants?
2014-07-28T12:32:54  <anteaya> can people walk in 10 minutes or less?
2014-07-28T12:33:23  <krtaylor> anteaya, I'd see about IBM picking that cost up, maybe dinners are on the group but breakfast/lunch shouldnt be a problem
2014-07-28T12:33:46  <krtaylor> anteaya, there are several close, 10-15 min walk
2014-07-28T12:34:01  <anteaya> well if IBM wants to pay for two meals a day, that is acceptable to have it from the campus caterers then
2014-07-28T12:34:09  <anteaya> krtaylor: how close are hotels?
2014-07-28T12:34:30  <krtaylor> I can't say for sure IBM will yet or not, but I can ask :)
2014-07-28T12:34:38  <anteaya> that is fine
2014-07-28T12:34:45  <anteaya> just outlining what we would need
2014-07-28T12:34:47  <krtaylor> there are prob 4-5 hotels within a mile

2014-07-28T12:35:01  <anteaya> what size of rooms can we get?
2014-07-28T12:35:01  *** aysyd has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T12:35:22  <krtaylor> anteaya, like I said, I have a notebook with all we'll need to get done, all contacts, everything
2014-07-28T12:35:29  <anteaya> great
2014-07-28T12:35:35  *** weshay has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T12:35:40  <anteaya> what size of rooms are available?
2014-07-28T12:35:59  <krtaylor> anteaya, room - I think I can get one of the big rooms, 40-50 shouldnt' be a problem
2014-07-28T12:36:15  <krtaylor> we have 3 or 4 that would work
2014-07-28T12:36:21  <anteaya> is there a room that would take 75 people if we got that many?
2014-07-28T12:36:52  <krtaylor> no, I think we'd have to cap it, but that seems to be a common approach
2014-07-28T12:37:23  <anteaya> so the largest room on the ibm campus could take 50 people max?
2014-07-28T12:38:20  <krtaylor> anteaya,  I need to check that
2014-07-28T12:38:23  <anteaya> kk
2014-07-28T12:38:25  <krtaylor> maybe larger
2014-07-28T12:38:31  <anteaya> let's find out
2014-07-28T12:39:15  *** eharney has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T12:39:40  <anteaya> so let's ensure we get confirmation that we can get a meeting room for at least 50 people for the first two days of Dec 1-5 2014, and break out rooms for the last 3 days of that week, about 15, 20 people per room, 3 or 4 of those
2014-07-28T12:39:44  <anteaya> av needs
2014-07-28T12:39:53  <anteaya> and breakfast and lunch for 50 people
2014-07-28T12:40:05  <anteaya> can you get that confirmation by August 15th?
2014-07-28T12:40:21  <anteaya> because if you can't, I will need time to find an alternate

2014-07-28T12:43:11  <anteaya> krtaylor: that is all I can think of
2014-07-28T12:43:28  <anteaya> if we can get confirmation of that by August 15th, then we have enough to move ahead
2014-07-28T12:43:41  <anteaya> if other requirements come up, we can address them as they arise
2014-07-28T12:43:57  <anteaya> but we need this in place to even say we are having an event
2014-07-28T12:43:59  <anteaya> and thanks
2014-07-28T12:44:04  <anteaya> keep me posted
2014-07-28T12:44:27  <krtaylor> the other prob is the time, right after turkey day in the US I believe
2014-07-28T12:44:36  * anteaya moves off to breakfast and resetting the pressure switch on the pump
2014-07-28T12:44:46  <krtaylor> some might not be back from holidy to fly out on the 1st
2014-07-28T12:45:04  <anteaya> krtaylor: then more space for folks from not us to attend
2014-07-28T12:45:15  <anteaya> I think we will be full with a waiting list
2014-07-28T12:45:19  <anteaya> my estimate
2014-07-28T12:45:21  <krtaylor> anteaya, we can talk about that part later though
2014-07-28T12:45:24  <krtaylor> cool
2014-07-28T12:45:43  <krtaylor> I was thinking 3-4 day would work too
2014-07-28T12:46:01  <krtaylor> but let me find the rooms and get approval, then we can figure that out

2014-07-28T13:14:02  <anteaya> and tests will fail until the dependency is merged, if tests depend on it

2014-07-28T13:31:52  <anteaya> thank you

2014-07-28T13:32:20  <anteaya> right
2014-07-28T13:32:22  <anteaya> good idea
2014-07-28T13:32:27  <anteaya> we have a new repo: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/infra-manual/
2014-07-28T13:32:30  <anteaya> it is a manual
2014-07-28T13:32:34  <joa> oh good
2014-07-28T13:32:42  <anteaya> and spot for third party has just been created
2014-07-28T13:32:57  <anteaya> would you be willing to transfer your etherpad to the manual?
2014-07-28T13:33:04  <joa> I guess it will be updated properly in parallel of the main openstack-infra/config repo ?
2014-07-28T13:33:15  *** openstackgerrit has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T13:33:22  <joa> I am,
2014-07-28T13:33:25  <anteaya> here is where it is published: http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/
2014-07-28T13:33:40  <anteaya> no, the manual is independent of the config repo
2014-07-28T13:34:11  <anteaya> and we are working on making the infra-manual to be a one stop guide for folks
2014-07-28T13:34:32  <joa> mhhh I mean, if some important thing changes (like the syntax to match trigger comments), it should be reflected in the manual repo too
2014-07-28T13:34:42  <anteaya> so if there is material published in two places we are working on making the material availabe in the manual and deleting other sources
2014-07-28T13:34:48  <anteaya> oh yes
2014-07-28T13:34:58  *** pcrews has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T13:35:02  <anteaya> yes, I see what you mean, yes, the manual must be kept up to date

2014-07-28T13:35:42  <joa> do you want me to putmy etherpad in a... redacted way ? (or at least a first attempt)
2014-07-28T13:35:57  <anteaya> start with one section
2014-07-28T13:36:07  <anteaya> look at the developer guide for an example
2014-07-28T13:36:15  <anteaya> break it up with headings
2014-07-28T13:36:35  <anteaya> since it will be the initial patch part of the feedback might be on how to set up this section
2014-07-28T13:36:44  <anteaya> so have a thick skin
2014-07-28T13:37:09  <anteaya> offer something and we will go from there
2014-07-28T13:37:34  <joa> okay, might  not be done for today but I'll work on it. Do you have any deadline for this ?
2014-07-28T13:37:43  <anteaya> no

2014-07-28T15:05:54  <fungi> concerns have been raised that allowing uploads of wheels without accompanying tarballs could lead to pypi distributing compiled binaries without distributing source for them, which might violate some free software licenses
2014-07-28T15:06:10  <yolanda> i also pushed a pair of changes to gerritlib and jeepyb that can be useful

2014-07-28T15:07:08  <mordred> why is this pypi's problem?
2014-07-28T15:07:38  <fungi> mordred: yeah, i know. i think there are just people who feel they need to be the license police
2014-07-28T15:07:49  <mordred> oh, well, they REALLY don't want to
2014-07-28T15:08:05  <mordred> because then they open themselves to liability, and it's almost impossible to get right

2014-07-28T15:14:11  <mordred> dstufft: they do realize that there are other things that are important than just getting included in the distros, right?
2014-07-28T15:14:24  <dstufft> I think it's a more or less pointless argument made by some random distro people

2014-07-28T15:15:38  * fungi can't imagine any distro worth discussing would be retrieving a wheel and building a distro package based on its contents

2014-07-28T15:15:52  *** dkehn_ is now known as dkehnx
2014-07-28T15:15:56  <mordred> fungi: also, it turns out you don't have to distribute source with binaries, even for the GPL
2014-07-28T15:16:01  <mordred> the source just has to be available
2014-07-28T15:16:14  <dstufft> fungi: well I think the thing is that by not uploading a sdist a distro can't package your thing
2014-07-28T15:16:22  <dstufft> and the distros obviously don't like that
2014-07-28T15:16:49  <fungi> mordred: correct. i suspect the "concern" raised is that wheels (which as you point out is also just as true for eggs) could encourage upstreams to no longer bother distributing source code corresponding to their releases
2014-07-28T15:16:56  *** dangers_away is now known as dangers
2014-07-28T15:16:57  <dhellmann> it's true that not having the sdist on pypi makes distro packaging slightly more challenging for smaller projects
2014-07-28T15:17:09  <mordred> yup
2014-07-28T15:17:34  <mordred> but you know what, the packager who wants to package a project should discuss that with the upstream if/when the packager wants to package that project
2014-07-28T15:17:43  <mordred> it's not a thing that's systemically accomplished
2014-07-28T15:17:44  <dhellmann> yeah
2014-07-28T15:17:55  <mordred> in debian, an ITP is filed, generally by a human who cares
2014-07-28T15:18:08  <fungi> i think the problem is the other way 'round though... if you don't put your release tarballs somewhere easily accessible to the public at large, distros aren't going to package and redistribute it. not sure why this is a problem for the distros themselves, just for the upstreams
2014-07-28T15:18:08  <mordred> that human has the ability to find where the source code actually lives
2014-07-28T15:18:17  <mordred> exactly
2014-07-28T15:18:31  <dstufft> fungi: because it makes more work for the distro people if they want to package your thing
2014-07-28T15:18:41  <dstufft> because now they have to convince you to publish an sdist
2014-07-28T15:18:47  <dstufft> instead of being able to just consume an already existing one

2014-07-28T15:28:44  <fungi> AJaeger: yeah, i suspect the nova-docker change at the top is killing its worker for that one job in such a way that zuul thinks jenkins is broken and keeps restarting it
2014-07-28T15:28:46  *** zns_ has quit IRC
2014-07-28T15:29:17  <fungi> AJaeger: the stuck jobs for the nova and neutron changes after it look like zuul never got the completion message from jenkins

2014-07-28T15:30:27  *** james_li has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T15:30:34  <fungi> the three stuck jobs are all on jenkins05, which isn't responding on its webui at the moment
2014-07-28T15:30:38  <fungi> i'll dig deeper
2014-07-28T15:31:35  <fungi> also the gate is full of breaking
2014-07-28T15:31:52  <fungi> that unstable ceilometer docs job seems to have failed to upload some files
2014-07-28T15:31:54  <AJaeger> fungi, wasn't jenkins05 not reachable last week ?
2014-07-28T15:31:58  <fungi> static.o.o might be in trouble
2014-07-28T15:32:22  *** yamamoto has quit IRC
2014-07-28T15:32:24  <fungi> AJaeger: yes, i believe so. this time it's less impacting, so i may leave it broken and open a support ticket

2014-07-28T15:33:32  <fungi> jenkins05 is responding to icmp echo requests, but i don't get the sshd banner on 22/tcp
2014-07-28T15:35:14  *** vermarah has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T15:35:20  <fungi> oh yeah, the docs-draft docroot on static.o.o is smack full
2014-07-28T15:36:04  <AJaeger> docs-draft? Is the documentation team creating too much content? ;(
2014-07-28T15:37:34  <fungi> i've added the remaining ~100gb we had in the vg to docs-draft (bringing it up to 1.5tb)
2014-07-28T15:38:05  <fungi> as soon as the fs resize completes, i'll start runnign a find to make sure we're properly expiring old content
2014-07-28T15:38:28  <fungi> but at least this should lift the pain

2014-07-28T15:42:12  <fungi> AJaeger: well, i don't think it's that we're not deleting. i think it's just that we're adding more projects with more gate-foo-docs jobs which all publish to docs-drafts and we may need to further shorten our retention window

2014-07-28T15:43:08  <AJaeger> fungi, are these that large? I think openstack-manuals is the largest one...
2014-07-28T15:43:08  <fungi> i believe when this came up a month ago i pointed out that the cron job which expires old content wasn't being aggressive enough, and SergeyLukjanov said he'd look at patching it
2014-07-28T15:44:37  <AJaeger> There'S a single dent in the last graph a month ago but steady growth afterwards

2014-07-28T15:51:05  <fungi> AJaeger: right now http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/config/tree/modules/openstack_project/files/log_archive_maintenance.sh currently only deletes *.gz files older than 21 days under /srv/static/docs-draft (and empty directories) but i think we can get rid of the -name \*.gz in there and have it apply to all files besides what's in lost+found
2014-07-28T15:51:30  <fungi> i'm testing that now and will push up a review of the same momentarily
2014-07-28T15:51:53  *** zul has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T15:52:00  <AJaeger> indeed, that would not delete lots of files - see http://docs-draft.openstack.org/97/109097/2/check/gate-openstack-manuals-tox-doc-publish-checkbuild/b8cfc81/publish-docs/
2014-07-28T15:52:15  <AJaeger> That should contain many files that are just plain html - or graphics etc.

2014-07-28T15:57:05  <clarkb> I see why we got stuck. I do not know why we tried to double report a change

2014-07-28T17:45:50  <asselin> clarkb, what's the sequence of event to help debug the issue. Zuul tells jenkins to put the node off line. Nodepool detect's the node is offline, then deletes it. nodepool detects it needs to launch new nodes and does so?

2014-07-28T17:47:04  <clarkb> asselin: zuul tells jenkins to run a job and mark the node it runs the job on offline when the job starts, jenkins completes the job and emits an event over the 0mq event publisher saying the job is done, nodepool receives the job complete event and marks the node that ran that job for deletion, nodepool node deleter thread deletes the node

2014-07-28T18:13:15  <craigbr> anteaya: In regards to https://review.openstack.org/108630, is the acl file optional? I thought it was required
2014-07-28T18:14:11  <clarkb> craigbr: the file itself is required, jeepyb knows where to look for that file by default so you don't have to list it in the projects.yaml file in all cases

2014-07-28T18:17:22  <craigbr> anteaya: That wasn't fixed on the second patch set but it still got a +2 so I was wondering if I was confused
2014-07-28T18:17:24  <anteaya> craigbr: now if there were a line in review.projects.yaml headed acl-config: then an acl file wouldn't be required for that patch
2014-07-28T18:17:48  <craigbr> anteaya: right. I checked for that
2014-07-28T18:18:03  <anteaya> or if there is an acl file with the project name already in http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/config/tree/modules/openstack_project/files/gerrit/acls/stackforge which there isn't
2014-07-28T18:18:16  <anteaya> craigbr: so you are correct, -1 patch needs an acl file
2014-07-28T18:18:23  <anteaya> good eye, sir
2014-07-28T18:18:34  <craigbr> anteaya: I will do that. Thanks
2014-07-28T18:18:42  <anteaya> link to an example of an acl file so they can use that as a template
2014-07-28T18:18:57  <anteaya> we need to ensure they know how to get a +1 when we give a -1
2014-07-28T18:19:52  <craigbr> Good idea. I didn't do that on the first one
2014-07-28T18:21:23  <anteaya> that is okay
2014-07-28T18:21:26  <anteaya> you are learning
2014-07-28T18:21:29  <anteaya> and doing a good job
2014-07-28T18:21:33  <anteaya> keep it up
2014-07-28T18:21:41  <craigbr> The check for an acl file seems like a fairly simple check to write for a check job. I'll see if I can add that

2014-07-28T18:27:30  *** rainya has quit IRC
2014-07-28T18:27:48  <fungi> Shrews: since your change is targeting tempest master and that job is testing tempest master changes against stable/icehouse branches, i think that's correct behavior (unless there was a tripleo-incubator stable/icehouse change ahead of it in the gate, but this failure was in the independent check pipeline so there wouldn't have been)

2014-07-28T18:44:21  <clarkb> jeblair: ohai! :) when you get a chance there are a couple zuul bug fixes floating around
2014-07-28T18:44:23  <fungi> which for python are often quite significant
2014-07-28T18:44:23  <jeblair> (teensy bugfix to the patch at the bottom of that stack)

2014-07-28T18:44:40  <jeblair> clarkb: plural? :)
2014-07-28T18:44:54  <clarkb> jeblair: ya fungi has one and I had one
2014-07-28T18:45:13  <clarkb> 11066 and 104963
2014-07-28T18:45:23  <jeblair> clarkb: thx, will review now
2014-07-28T18:45:31  <clarkb> arg I used lp for the zuul bug
2014-07-28T18:45:33  <clarkb> I fail
2014-07-28T18:45:41  <fungi> mine is probably fairly low-priority, and just addresses the changes which fail to get reported on when a parent change fails in a dependent pipeline
2014-07-28T18:45:48  <jeblair> clarkb: zuul bugs are still in lp
2014-07-28T18:45:51  <clarkb> oh good
2014-07-28T18:45:51  <fungi> whereas clarkb's addresses a (hopefully rare) deadlock
2014-07-28T18:46:26  <redrobot> SergeyLukjanov ping
2014-07-28T18:46:50  <jeblair> clarkb: what was the issue that triggered your deadlock?
2014-07-28T18:47:37  <fungi> (pipeline deadlock, not a process deadlock thankfully)
2014-07-28T18:47:38  <clarkb> jeblair: late friday, zuul stopped doing all work not in check. It got an SSHException when trying to check if a change merged. At that point it went into an infinite loop failing to report that change
2014-07-28T18:47:56  <clarkb> jeblair: basically every time it processed queues it failed on that change, then tried to process queues again

2014-07-28T18:48:26  <clarkb> I had to slice through many gigs of logs to find that :)
2014-07-28T18:48:27  <jeblair> clarkb: so the trigger was a transient network error at a certain place?

2014-07-28T18:50:30  <clarkb> and it was halting stuff
2014-07-28T18:50:41  <clarkb> today I caught up and properly debugged it

2014-07-28T19:04:34  <krtaylor> beecee, which driver will your CI system be testing?
2014-07-28T19:05:13  <armax> clarkb: thanks for the reviews, I adjusted the patches to address your comments
2014-07-28T19:05:20  *** mpaolino has quit IRC
2014-07-28T19:05:27  <clarkb> thanks
2014-07-28T19:05:33  <armax> clarkb: thank you
2014-07-28T19:05:38  <beecee> anteaya: only in the last 2 weeks
2014-07-28T19:06:03  <krtaylor> beecee, for instance, nova requirements are here: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/HypervisorSupportMatrix
2014-07-28T19:06:29  <beecee> krtaylor: cinder/zadara .  we first heard about it from DuncanT-'s mail out, and my boss handed off the task to me, so I'm coming at this fresh
2014-07-28T19:06:44  <jeblair> clarkb: i'm a little worried that with your fix we could end up in an infinite reporting loop
2014-07-28T19:07:22  <clarkb> jeblair: hrm maybe. like if gerrit goes sideways
2014-07-28T19:07:25  <krtaylor> beecee, understood, there are several -cinder groups starting to test drivers
2014-07-28T19:07:34  <jeblair> clarkb: there are two actions handled in the reporting: leaving a vote and verifying that the change merged (if applicable)
2014-07-28T19:07:35  <clarkb> or that change makes itself unhappy
2014-07-28T19:07:36  <anteaya> beecee: you hadn't heard about the need to test your driver prior to DuncanT's email?
2014-07-28T19:07:44  *** SumitNaiksatam has quit IRC
2014-07-28T19:07:51  <anteaya> beecee: just trying to understand your perspective here
2014-07-28T19:07:54  <krtaylor> I was about to ask the same
2014-07-28T19:08:02  <anteaya> krtaylor: also if you can review this series: https://review.openstack.org/#/q/status:open+project:openstack-infra/gerrit+branch:openstack/2.8.4,n,z
2014-07-28T19:08:18  <clarkb> jeblair I can look at it more in the afternoon
2014-07-28T19:08:20  <anteaya> krtaylor: this is to get me gerrit permissions to create and edit third party ci accounts
2014-07-28T19:08:31  <clarkb> it did bend my mind a bit this morning
2014-07-28T19:08:49  <jeblair> clarkb: in fact, i think your change would report results twice for the incident that triggered this
2014-07-28T19:09:01  <jeblair> clarkb: because it was the verification that failed, not the actual reporting
2014-07-28T19:09:17  <clarkb> right so there is a check to see if we reported
2014-07-28T19:09:21  <beecee> anteaya: there's a difference between myself hearing about it, and the company hearing about it.  I hadn't, and from asking around internally, the people previously responsible for openstack integration hadn't either
2014-07-28T19:09:32  <clarkb> so it would report and succeed then verification failed
2014-07-28T19:09:34  <anteaya> zaro: I think we have some rebase syntax in this file: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/109796/1/Documentation/cmd-set-account.txt
2014-07-28T19:09:47  <anteaya> line 26 <<<<<<< HEAD
2014-07-28T19:09:50  <clarkb> so next time through it skips reporting and verification succeeds
2014-07-28T19:10:00  <jeblair> clarkb: ah true, so it would not report twice
2014-07-28T19:10:03  <anteaya> and line 41 >>>>>>> aa49e27... Allow to delegate modify account commands to non administrators
2014-07-28T19:10:10  <clarkb> jeblair the important bit is the first part of reportItem()
2014-07-28T19:10:34  <anteaya> beecee: okay, so that is a gap we need to address
2014-07-28T19:10:39  <krtaylor> anteaya, will do
2014-07-28T19:10:46  *** melwitt has quit IRC
2014-07-28T19:10:51  <anteaya> beecee: because it is hard to address something if you don't know about it
2014-07-28T19:10:58  <jeblair> clarkb: okay, so we may actually be sufficiently protected
2014-07-28T19:11:02  *** melwitt has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T19:11:13  <beecee> anteaya: in previous companies, I did CI stuff, so I'm personally in favour of having everything continually tested, but I'm chasing the formal rationale from openstack as to why actual $$ should be spent ;)
2014-07-28T19:11:24  <anteaya> beecee: so let's continue, so here you are, you found the third party meeting, well done and you know about the ci.openstack.org third party requirements
2014-07-28T19:11:45  <anteaya> beecee: got it
2014-07-28T19:11:54  <anteaya> beecee: let's start from your prior experience then
2014-07-28T19:12:00  <anteaya> that sounds like a happy place
2014-07-28T19:12:03  <anteaya> and then expand
2014-07-28T19:13:31  <jeblair> clarkb: okay, so i think we're only as suceptible to reporting loops as we are now (and that would be only if gerrit records a vote but still returns error).  i think that's okay.
2014-07-28T19:13:46  <clarkb> cool
2014-07-28T19:13:51  <jeblair> clarkb: if we wanted to be extra paranoid, we could eject the change from the queue with a try/finally around reportItem
2014-07-28T19:13:57  <jeblair> clarkb: but i don't think that's necessary
2014-07-28T19:14:07  <jeblair> at least, not yet :)

2014-07-28T19:15:32  <beecee> anteaya: the formal requirements that I've found are technical in nature.  the assumption is that you've woken up one day and said 'hey, I've got a 3rd party driver that I want to maintain in openstack, how do I go about testing it on every commit'

2014-07-28T19:18:42  <mordred> anteaya: the ramifications of not chosing to test your driver on every commit

2014-07-28T19:19:41  <anteaya> beecee: well you have it already, if you choose to not test your driver, it will eventually be deprecated from openstack
2014-07-28T19:19:54  <beecee> anteaya: yes, I know that.  but where is that written?
2014-07-28T19:19:57  <anteaya> beecee: what project? cinder right?
2014-07-28T19:20:05  <anteaya> well it is just in the logs
2014-07-28T19:20:12  <beecee> anteaya: cinder specifically, openstack in general

2014-07-28T19:20:32  <anteaya> right
2014-07-28T19:20:47  <anteaya> well we haven't put it in front of the technical committee
2014-07-28T19:21:00  <anteaya> since right now we are working hard to get things shored up
2014-07-28T19:21:07  *** emagana has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T19:21:22  <anteaya> and deadlines are on a per project basis
2014-07-28T19:21:40  <anteaya> but openstack's axiom is if it isn't tested, it's broken
2014-07-28T19:21:55  <anteaya> and the third party code didn't come in through the front door
2014-07-28T19:22:07  <anteaya> is sort of eased in through the side, one project at a time
2014-07-28T19:22:12  <openstackgerrit> Kim Jensen proposed a change to openstack-infra/infra-manual: Added some initial content in Peer Review before ReviewChecklist link  https://review.openstack.org/107588
2014-07-28T19:22:13  <openstackgerrit> Alexandre Viau proposed a change to openstack-infra/config: Added Jenkins jobs for Surveil  https://review.openstack.org/110094
2014-07-28T19:22:24  <anteaya> until it threatened the stability of one notable project
2014-07-28T19:22:33  <anteaya> so openstack as a whole is trying to do this dance
2014-07-28T19:22:40  <anteaya> and right now everyone is doing it differently
2014-07-28T19:22:53  <anteaya> and we are on a spectrum, which we are trying to formalize
2014-07-28T19:22:56  <anteaya> but we aren't there yet
2014-07-28T19:23:22  <anteaya> and when we try to formalize too quickly we risk upsetting some folks, who want to play but didn't know what was expected of them
2014-07-28T19:23:28  <anteaya> such as yourself
2014-07-28T19:23:33  <anteaya> so there is a balance
2014-07-28T19:23:40  <anteaya> but the quality was in question
2014-07-28T19:23:46  <anteaya> and needed to be addressed
2014-07-28T19:24:11  <anteaya> so actually a lot of this current situation comes from last release and the initiative of neutron
2014-07-28T19:24:22  <anteaya> and my stick weilding in that program
2014-07-28T19:24:40  <krtaylor> yes, and there is a lot of "understood" info that is in the process of being written down, its getting better
2014-07-28T19:24:41  <anteaya> so we have started to get some process in place
2014-07-28T19:24:49  <anteaya> not fast enough for some, too fast for others
2014-07-28T19:25:11  <anteaya> so trying to keep the group together is a lot of running from edge to edge
2014-07-28T19:25:13  <anteaya> exhausting
2014-07-28T19:25:31  <anteaya> and if you wait for formalized policy you will honestly be missing the boat
2014-07-28T19:25:37  <anteaya> join us and make the policy
2014-07-28T19:25:41  <anteaya> don't wait to read it

2014-07-28T19:27:31  <anteaya> but the heart of it is, if it isn't tested, it's broken

2014-07-28T19:28:20  <fungi> clarkb: mordred: jeblair: if you find yourselves periodically getting unsubscribed from lists.o.o mls like i am, i've tracked down a significant cause... some worms are spoofing mailer-daemon and postmaster for that fqdn in list posts, mailman is rejecting the posts and bouncing them to *us* and them my mta (but also at least gmail) is rejecting them as containing malware, and mailman incorrectly
2014-07-28T19:28:22  <fungi> identifies these as us bouncing ml post deliveries and increments our bounce scores

2014-07-28T20:47:17  <asselin> fungi, jeblair any idea when this will be released? https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/config/tree/modules/openstack_project/manifests/jenkins.pp#n84
2014-07-28T20:52:58  <fungi> asselin: i'm not certain what the latest thinking was there... i believe it's a fork of a deprecated/defunct plugin to which console log collection was added, but no idea if the idea is to recombine it or take it over or what
2014-07-28T20:53:13  *** yamahata_ has joined #openstack-infra
2014-07-28T20:55:02  <fungi> i find old discussions about abandoning it in favor of the publish-over-ssh plugin, but its current state still seems to lack console log collection based on my (albeit cursory) review
2014-07-28T20:56:57  <asselin> fungi, ok I see. Do you know if anyone is working on finding a solution to this?
2014-07-28T20:57:50  <fungi> asselin: not to my knowledge. i think most current effort in openstack-infra is tending toward working on replacing jenkins rather than further improvements to jenkins plugins we're running
2014-07-28T20:58:34  <asselin> fungi, ok yes I remember that discussion. ok I'll leave it as-is then.

2014-07-28T22:34:19  <anteaya> not sure I will be able to be in the same room as you
2014-07-28T22:34:39  <anteaya> mattoliverau: ah just invoking the rock does it

2014-07-28T22:36:10  <beecee> Was that another bit of silliness from the last summit?
2014-07-28T22:36:13  <anteaya> well it went like this
2014-07-28T22:36:34  <anteaya> so on the saturday after summit me and the australians went to the atlanta aquarium
2014-07-28T22:36:34  *** camunoz has quit IRC
2014-07-28T22:36:43  <anteaya> and I loved it, and they had to keep fetching me
2014-07-28T22:36:51  <anteaya> we had a great time
2014-07-28T22:36:56  <anteaya> we went to the gift shop
2014-07-28T22:37:18  <anteaya> and pleia2 had been sick and couldn't make it to summit, so I bought her a stuffed otter by way of saying we miss you
2014-07-28T22:37:27  <anteaya> and so they were waiting for me in the gift shop
2014-07-28T22:37:33  <anteaya> so then I finished and we left
2014-07-28T22:37:44  *** dkliban has quit IRC
2014-07-28T22:37:45  <anteaya> turns out jhesketh had also made a purchase
2014-07-28T22:37:49  <anteaya> a rock
2014-07-28T22:37:58  <anteaya> with a usp cable stuck to it
2014-07-28T22:38:08  <anteaya> in a box, with a booklet of instructions
2014-07-28T22:38:16  <anteaya> and mikal lost his mind
2014-07-28T22:38:21  <anteaya> couldn't stop giggling
2014-07-28T22:38:28  <anteaya> for like 20 minutes
2014-07-28T22:38:33  <anteaya> best time of the summit
2014-07-28T22:38:52  <nibalizer> what did lsusb show?
2014-07-28T22:38:55  <anteaya> every time he was in danger of stopping he would ask jhesketh a question about the purchase
2014-07-28T22:39:02  <anteaya> jhesketh: ^^ ?
2014-07-28T22:39:08  <nibalizer> we need to know
2014-07-28T22:39:12  <anteaya> like how much he paid for it
2014-07-28T22:39:20  <anteaya> jhesketh said it was on sale
2014-07-28T22:39:22  *** mfink has quit IRC
2014-07-28T22:39:30  <anteaya> that was good for about another 5 minutes
2014-07-28T22:39:44  <anteaya> mikal also asked if there was a book of instructions
2014-07-28T22:39:46  <anteaya> there was
2014-07-28T22:39:50  <anteaya> it was blank pages
2014-07-28T22:40:00  <jogo> anteaya: yeah, it will be interesting, that is for sure
2014-07-28T22:40:01  <anteaya> that was good for a few minutes as well
2014-07-28T22:40:06  <beecee> anteaya: not the strangest usb thing I've seen.  skymall back from atlanta offered a 'usb paper towel holder' with an interchangable wine stopper as an ornamental feature on top
2014-07-28T22:40:16  <anteaya> beecee: ha ha ha
2014-07-28T22:40:38  <anteaya> beecee: like because when I have wet hands needing usb activity is my first though
2014-07-28T22:40:40  <anteaya> t
2014-07-28T22:42:04  <beecee> but.. a rock.

2014-07-28T23:09:36  <fungi> okay, jenkins05 has been gracefully stopped, all associated nodes deleted from nodepool/jenkins and then started again. i'm going to make a pass to clean up alien nodepool orphans in our providers too while i'm at it
2014-07-28T23:11:20  <anteaya> any indication what happened to jenkins05?

2014-07-28T23:12:13  <fungi> anteaya: nope. it just seems to have stopped receiving any tcp/udp traffic for nearly 30 hours and then magically reappeared. so far rackspace hasn't picked up the support ticket i opened earlier in the day

2014-07-28T23:16:44  <fungi> anteaya: though if it starts piling on ready nodes which are actually used, then i guess we're looking at a nodepool restart

2014-07-28T23:17:31  <anteaya> interesting
2014-07-28T23:17:48  <fungi> since that'll be a sign nodepool isn't watching its zmq events
2014-07-28T23:18:02  <anteaya> are those 2 33 hour jobs at the top of check from when jenkins05 disappeared
2014-07-28T23:18:09  <fungi> yeah
