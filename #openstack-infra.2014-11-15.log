2014-11-15T15:47:48  <foobio> since i didn't see any activity at all in the bug report, i (wrongly) assumed nobody else was working on it yet. didn't notice you opened a second bug report after that
2014-11-15T15:48:19  <sdague> yeh, sorry, I looked for an ER signature, and not seeing one, I opened a bug and went from there
2014-11-15T15:48:36  <foobio> makes sense. too many entry points

2014-11-15T19:12:22  <foobio> Daviey: looks like glance-store is trying to declare it
2014-11-15T19:12:26  <foobio> Daviey: i think this means that glance-store is not safe for stable/juno

2014-11-15T19:12:33  <foobio> dhellmann: ^
2014-11-15T19:12:36  <foobio> so basically oslo.middleware is in stable/juno projects.txt and declares a requirement for oslo.middleware which is not in stable/juno global-requirements.txt
2014-11-15T19:12:40  <foobio> Daviey: dhellmann: not sure whether that means we need to add oslo.middleware to juno global reqs (is that a violation of our stable branch policies?) or give oslo.messaging a stable/juno branch which doesn't need oslo.middleware
2014-11-15T19:12:40  *** waynr1 is now known as waynr
2014-11-15T19:12:46  <foobio> lifeless: interestingly, we weren't pinning unittest2 at all in global-reqs so something else was forcing it to an older release
2014-11-15T19:12:49  <foobio> lifeless: aha! we're installing ubuntu's python-unittest2 package
2014-11-15T19:12:54  <foobio> so i think this may need to be fixed in devstack
2014-11-15T19:13:48  <Daviey> foobio: here
2014-11-15T19:14:01  <Daviey> foobio: you went through the identical thought process as me
2014-11-15T19:14:18  <foobio> Daviey: yep, freenode was getting in the way
2014-11-15T19:15:02  <Daviey> foobio: I really don't think we can add unittest2 as a requirement, but i added a cherrypick incase.

2014-11-15T19:17:21  <Daviey> foobio: Yeah, introducing a new requirement feels pretty wrong on stable/*
2014-11-15T19:17:40  <foobio> Daviey: totally agree
2014-11-15T19:17:50  <Daviey> foobio: I suspect we either need to try and get https://github.com/openstack/oslo.messaging/commit/10eb1202b37f896e1b7844d400e0defd926a7ab1 backed out from Master, or cut a stable/juno release of that
2014-11-15T19:18:14  <Daviey> It was only merged 2 days ago...
2014-11-15T19:19:02  <foobio> Daviey: yep, whichever dhellmann prefers (i suspect he'll want to to with the latter)
2014-11-15T19:19:06  <Daviey> Hmm.. What about introducing a pin for oslo.messaging in juno?
2014-11-15T19:19:28  <foobio> Daviey: oh, good point... that is what we agreed to in the oslo versioning summit session after all
2014-11-15T19:19:37  <foobio> we just haven't gotten around to doing it yet
2014-11-15T19:19:45  <Daviey> :)
2014-11-15T19:19:52  <Daviey> I'll do that now.
2014-11-15T19:19:53  <foobio> that way oslo.messaging doesn't need a stable/juno branch until there's something to backport

2014-11-15T19:34:46  <foobio> Daviey: did we really introduce a new requirement in oslo.messaging 1.4.1? that should totally have been 1.5.0 instead
2014-11-15T19:36:08  *** vponomaryov has joined #openstack-infra
2014-11-15T19:36:09  <foobio> Daviey: in light of that, i think we need a !=1.4.1 followed by a 1.4.2 tag on top of the 1.4.0 commit (or a revert, tag, and unrevert), then retag tip of master as 1.5.0
2014-11-15T19:36:17  <Daviey> foobio: Oh, i pinned to the latest version on pypi

2014-11-15T19:40:40  <lifeless> Daviey: what about adding oslo.middleware for juno ?

2014-11-15T19:41:49  <foobio> lifeless: Daviey: sdague: also pushed up https://review.openstack.org/134728 and two corresponding stable backports to see if we can solve the testtools/unittest2 dilemma

2014-11-15T19:49:24  <Daviey> Well, if it is a upper bound version - it should use pypi IMO.. If it isn't, then using Master (unless it is a project that contains stable/* and it is for a stable project, then use that branch latest)

2014-11-15T20:38:14  <foobio> harlowja_at_home: oslo/messaging/notify/middleware.py is apparently using it
2014-11-15T20:38:19  <harlowja_at_home> gotcha, still sorta feels odd to have a messaging library have wsgi middleware in it, but i guess thats the situation we are in :-/
2014-11-15T20:38:52  <harlowja_at_home> instead of the reverse (where oslo.middleware has this code)
2014-11-15T20:38:54  *** gokrokve has quit IRC
2014-11-15T20:39:01  <harlowja_at_home> anyways, something to fix later i guess
2014-11-15T20:39:02  <Daviey> Well, it seems entirely appropriate change for Master.. but not something we can have on stable/*
2014-11-15T20:39:19  <foobio> harlowja_at_home: might make sense to move the notification middleware into oslo.middleware i s'pose
2014-11-15T20:39:32  <harlowja_at_home> foobio,  agreed
2014-11-15T20:39:34  <mordred> yah. but that's where our some-libraries-do-not-have-stable-branches policy is kicking us in the face
2014-11-15T20:39:37  <Daviey> Which is why I think we need to focus on installing oslo.middlware via pip if there is an upperbound version

2014-11-15T20:40:30  *** viglesias has quit IRC
2014-11-15T20:40:33  <mordred> I think, even though it's more complex, we may want to consider (even though I've said no in the past) having stable versions of _everything_ ... BUT - also making sure that master of python-*client can still consume api services of old stable releases
2014-11-15T20:40:40  <mordred> since python-*client has double-duty
2014-11-15T20:40:52  *** e0ne has quit IRC
2014-11-15T20:41:02  <mordred> the reason to not have stables is to avoid a situation where an end user has to ahve two different versions of python-novaclient to talk to two different clouds
2014-11-15T20:41:04  <foobio> mordred: long-term, we should fix *that* problem instead (the double-duty)
2014-11-15T20:41:20  <mordred> foobio: the more I think about the double-duty problem, the more I think it's impossible to fix
2014-11-15T20:41:35  <Daviey> It's a catch 22
2014-11-15T20:41:38  <mordred> because if we make python-openstacksdk the end-user SDK, then why wouldn't the server projects also switch to use it
2014-11-15T20:41:43  <mordred> they all consume public APIs
2014-11-15T20:42:02  <foobio> mordred: openstack-sdk to the rescue? one set of libraries for stable inter-service communication, another for clients, end users and application developers?
2014-11-15T20:42:07  *** jesusaurus has joined #openstack-infra
2014-11-15T20:42:08  <mordred> we need stable versions of the python-*client or the sdks for stable versions of the servers to use
2014-11-15T20:42:10  <foobio> ahh, yep
2014-11-15T20:42:23  <mordred> but we also need to make sure we don't accidentally break backwards compat
2014-11-15T20:42:24  *** banix has joined #openstack-infra
2014-11-15T20:42:36  <foobio> mordred: so anyway, i guess the real answer is "stabilize our apis"
2014-11-15T20:42:45  <mordred> actually, they're pretty stable
2014-11-15T20:42:55  <Daviey> Ah, that is a graceful solution.  That means that the client themselves are thin wrappers around the SDK, and you can presumably have versioned SDK's installed concurrently?
2014-11-15T20:43:13  <mordred> no - I think we don't need to be able to have concurrent SDKs installed
2014-11-15T20:43:24  <mordred> I think more we need to understand that there are two different install vectors we care about
2014-11-15T20:43:29  <mordred> people deploying, and people consuming
2014-11-15T20:43:33  <mordred> and _those_ don't need to match
2014-11-15T20:43:33  <Daviey> Doesn't that just move the problem up the stack?
2014-11-15T20:43:41  <foobio> sdks that know how to properly interact with multiple api versions and degrade gracefully
2014-11-15T20:43:49  <Daviey> Ah true
2014-11-15T20:43:53  *** yodayosi has joined #openstack-infra
2014-11-15T20:44:07  <mordred> right. but nothing about the current lib situation actually makes that better
2014-11-15T20:44:16  <mordred> so we're not _solving_ the end user api problem with our current approach
2014-11-15T20:44:22  <mordred> AND we're shooting ourselves in teh head
2014-11-15T20:44:36  *** yodayosi has quit IRC
2014-11-15T20:45:22  <Daviey> So.. back to the fire fight.  How are we solving the immediate problem?
2014-11-15T20:45:43  <Daviey> I quite think that pinning is the correct fix for stable/*
2014-11-15T20:45:46  <foobio> so perhaps the underlying problem is that we want it to be possible to install the latest client libs on the same systems where we're also installing stable server branches
2014-11-15T20:45:46  <mordred> yes
2014-11-15T20:45:54  <mordred> foobio: I don't think we do
2014-11-15T20:45:54  <Daviey> But CI needs to install from pip not Master
2014-11-15T20:46:09  <foobio> mordred: by "want" i mean our tooling as designed makes that assumption now
2014-11-15T20:46:12  <mordred> foobio: I think that we currently have no other model than doing that
2014-11-15T20:46:13  <mordred> yah
2014-11-15T20:46:14  <foobio> not that it's a sane desire
2014-11-15T20:47:08  *** viglesias has joined #openstack-infra
2014-11-15T20:47:13  <mordred> Daviey: I agree with what you have said
2014-11-15T20:47:17  <foobio> a way out would be to have stable branches of client libs, declare that those will be maintained to talk to servers at least as old as they are, and also make sure latest versions of the client libs can talk to older servers but don't necessarily have to be coinstallable on the same machines
2014-11-15T20:47:44  <Daviey> foobio: the issue is that we want people to install a client, and be able to talk to any cloud
2014-11-15T20:47:49  <Daviey> That doesn't help with that?
2014-11-15T20:48:01  <foobio> that covers the end user/app dev use cases as well as the stable release server inter-communication case where we need coinstallability
2014-11-15T20:48:41  *** p5ntangle has joined #openstack-infra
2014-11-15T20:48:58  <foobio> Daviey: people who install a client will want to install a new enough client to talk to all the clouds they use. servers where we need the client installed as a dependency of a stable server mostly only need to talk to services of the same vintage
2014-11-15T20:50:19  <mordred> ++
2014-11-15T20:50:24  <mordred> I agree 100%
2014-11-15T20:50:29  <foobio> and that solves the "new novaclient wants features in a more recent urllib2 than stable/icehouse nova can work with" or some such (contrived example)
2014-11-15T20:50:56  <foobio> e.g. the conflicting dependencies problem
2014-11-15T20:51:17  <mordred> I don't think it's reasonable to expect, if you are running precise and have installed python-novaclient from precise, that your novaclient will talk to all clouds in the wild - but I _do_ think it's reasonable that if you pip install latest novaclient that you should be able to talk to all clouds in existence
2014-11-15T20:51:38  <Daviey> foobio: Ah, good point
2014-11-15T20:51:53  <mordred> foobio: you wanna write this up for the list or you want me to?
2014-11-15T20:52:00  <foobio> mordred: and conversely, that if you install nova and novaclient from precise, that they will work together correctly and not depend on conflicting things (basically as guarantee of the distro)

2014-11-15T20:53:15  <foobio> agreed
2014-11-15T20:53:39  <foobio> so to bring it back to the currently relevant topic, what does our ideal requirements integration job look like in that new landscape
2014-11-15T20:53:41  <foobio> >?
2014-11-15T20:54:02  <foobio> because "install everything from branch tip" certainly isn't the answer any longer
2014-11-15T20:54:16  <foobio> and we're already ditching that for devstack-based jobs
2014-11-15T20:54:29  <Daviey> foobio: It is, unless the scenario I outlined earlier i think
2014-11-15T20:55:04  <mordred> yah
2014-11-15T20:55:09  <Daviey> ~If we don't default to installing from Master/tip, the issues won't be found until a pip release is cut.  So defering the problem
2014-11-15T20:55:51  <foobio> going back to basic principles, what do we want to be testing with that job which we don't get from the other integration tests run on global-reqs changes (e.g. devstack already runs with requirements level-set to the proposed change)
2014-11-15T20:56:18  <mordred> right. but - if we do that as step one (default to pip if not testing change on that repo)
2014-11-15T20:56:33  <mordred> and we add pins in the stable branches
2014-11-15T20:56:41  <foobio> for the job in question, i think "that repo" is always openstack/requirements right?
2014-11-15T20:56:48  <mordred> then the only thing we'll be missing is how to make changes to the "stable" python clients
2014-11-15T20:57:03  <Daviey> foobio: do you disagree with:
2014-11-15T20:57:04  <Daviey> 19:49 < Daviey> Well, if it is a upper bound version - it should use pypi IMO.. If it isn't, then using Master (unless it is a project that contains stable/* and it is for a stable project, then use that branch latest)
2014-11-15T20:57:11  <mordred> and then once we have stable/* branches for each client, we can go back to defaulting to $branch
2014-11-15T20:57:19  <mordred> yes
2014-11-15T20:57:25  <mordred> Daviey: you said it very succinctly

2014-11-15T21:02:07  <foobio> mordred: so... the recent changes to devstack-gate based jobs have solved that, but the requirements integration job has its own install tests which don't
2014-11-15T21:02:17  <lifeless> mordred: so why then?
2014-11-15T21:02:47  <foobio> lifeless: solving the co-installability problem
2014-11-15T21:03:01  <lifeless> foobio: cocowhatwhatnownow?
2014-11-15T21:03:30  <Daviey> If only we had an upcoming Summit to discuss this.
2014-11-15T21:03:31  <mordred> lifeless: stable nova install needs to talk to keystone and uses python-keystoneclient
2014-11-15T21:03:37  <foobio> lifeless: latest glanceclient conflicting with requirements of older nova so can't install them on the same machine allowing nova to talk to glance seamlessly
2014-11-15T21:03:59  <mordred> lifeless: the current situation is that master python*client still work - but pull in new requirements
2014-11-15T21:04:08  <mordred> like oslo.config
2014-11-15T21:04:15  <mordred> which is then very weird for the stable server
2014-11-15T21:04:26  <lifeless> mordred: ok, and oslo.config also has a semver stable approach, right?
2014-11-15T21:04:26  <mordred> Daviey: I know, right?

2014-11-15T21:05:55  *** banix has joined #openstack-infra
2014-11-15T21:06:27  <foobio> and so we can then increment z for security backports to the juno version of oslo.config while introducing non-stable-compliant changes in master
2014-11-15T21:07:02  <lifeless> foobio: so this makes me hate our stable branch guff all the more.
2014-11-15T21:07:03  <foobio> essentially the same stable branching pattern the servers are using
2014-11-15T21:07:18  <lifeless> The rest of the universe doesn't do stable branches just because someone happens to use a release.
2014-11-15T21:07:33  <lifeless> e.g. glibc
2014-11-15T21:07:39  <openstackgerrit> Cedric Brandily proposed openstack-infra/git-review: Test git-review CI (not to merge)  https://review.openstack.org/130949
2014-11-15T21:07:46  <lifeless> ok, glibc is a bad example because it does. Sigh.
2014-11-15T21:07:52  *** zz_dimtruck is now known as dimtruck
2014-11-15T21:08:09  <foobio> lifeless: the rest of the (distro) universe instead manages what amounts to their own stable branches rather than collaborating on common stable branches
2014-11-15T21:08:10  <Daviey> lifeless: Hmm.. Many projects maintain stable branches.
2014-11-15T21:08:14  *** HeOS has joined #openstack-infra
2014-11-15T21:08:37  <mordred> yah. I keep trying to justify killing them and I keep failing when I go to grab ammunition
2014-11-15T21:09:00  <Daviey> The whole point of the stable/* was to stop, collaborate and listen. Ice
2014-11-15T21:09:36  <foobio> the goal of our stable branch maintenance has always been to give distro packagers a place to collaborate on their backports, and to provide a means for our upstream devs to helpfully pre-roll security fixes for the benefit of the distro packagers collaborating there
2014-11-15T21:09:57  <lifeless> so perhaps my feeling here is driven by conflating two things
2014-11-15T21:10:07  <lifeless> three
2014-11-15T21:10:12  <lifeless> one is 'we need to test upgrades'
2014-11-15T21:10:50  <lifeless> two is 'we want to know that our new api-compatible project releases work with our break-the-world(apiservers)-project-releases'
2014-11-15T21:11:02  <lifeless> three is 'we want stable maintenance work to be collaborative'
2014-11-15T21:11:10  *** p5ntangle has quit IRC
2014-11-15T21:11:15  <foobio> the complication which has arisen, i think, is mostly due to our insistence on testing what's proposed to stable branches rather than just crossing our fingers and hoping proposed changes don't break things for downstream packagers
2014-11-15T21:11:40  <lifeless> we're using one mechanism to drive three very distinct things
2014-11-15T21:11:54  <foobio> (e.g. giving packagers a place to collaborate on testing proposed backports rather than just a place to review them)
2014-11-15T21:11:57  <lifeless> all of those things are valuable in different ways, to different audiences
2014-11-15T21:11:57  <Daviey> I proposed stable branches, as I was at that pointed managing the ubuntu server team and I could see our delta growing and it seemed silly to watch other distros doing the same thing.
2014-11-15T21:12:17  <Daviey> s/pointed/pont/
2014-11-15T21:12:22  <lifeless> Daviey: I think collaborative stable maintenance is a good thing.
2014-11-15T21:12:53  <lifeless> Daviey: the infectious nature of the implementation frustrates me from time to time
2014-11-15T21:13:13  <lifeless> Daviey: I'm just starting to articulate why :)
2014-11-15T21:13:15  <Daviey> well, it is indeed embarrasing that stable/* is currently blocking Master
2014-11-15T21:13:16  <foobio> it does take on a life of its own if we don't step back and remind ourselves why it's there from time to time
2014-11-15T21:13:54  <Daviey> Well, stable has grown to also include the CD deployers aswell now.
2014-11-15T21:14:04  *** gokrokve has joined #openstack-infra
2014-11-15T21:14:50  <lifeless> it has?
2014-11-15T21:14:54  <lifeless> Daviey: which ones?
2014-11-15T21:15:04  <foobio> i think continuous deployment from stable branches wasn't a design goal originally? i'm worried that declaring it's something we as a community find desirable may hamstring us in other ways
2014-11-15T21:15:08  <Daviey> Well, *I* do.  And i know of a few others.
2014-11-15T21:15:22  <lifeless> Daviey: so you deploy trunk using stable tooling?
2014-11-15T21:15:31  <lifeless> Daviey: (I'm trying to reconcile the statement...)

2014-11-15T21:17:02  <Daviey> lifeless: Going off topic now.. but the intent is to have a Production Series and a Development Series.  Production series is the latest stable/* tip, with internal dev, qa and prod enviroment.  But also a CD(?, sort of) deployment of Master, with dev and qa enviroments to flush out breakage before it impacts us.
2014-11-15T21:17:26  <Daviey> When a Master release is cut, a prod enviroment is created from that, and Production and Development Series moves on one
2014-11-15T21:17:58  <Daviey> But the underlying point is, stable/* is slurped up in a CD workflow.

2014-11-15T21:22:55  <lifeless> Daviey: not crazy, since keeping inventory low is valuable anywhere
2014-11-15T21:22:59  <foobio> i'm sure this is entirely because i'm missing the business logic driving those choices, but it does sound like overengineered process for process' sake
2014-11-15T21:23:13  <Daviey> It does mix CD with traditional, in that there is a major upgrade every 6 months.. but to a tested and integrated enviroment
2014-11-15T21:23:24  <lifeless> Daviey: but the increased pressure on stable/ to not change at all - transitively - I consider a bad thing.
2014-11-15T21:23:32  <lifeless> Daviey: the point of CD is to *enable* change, not to prevent it.
2014-11-15T21:24:06  <Daviey> foobio: business smisniss.
2014-11-15T21:24:22  *** talluri has quit IRC
2014-11-15T21:24:38  <Daviey> lifeless: The trouble with allowing new deps is that we break stable distros.
2014-11-15T21:25:17  <foobio> Daviey: i think the disconnect here is between "allowing" new dependencies and "testing with" new dependencies
2014-11-15T21:25:17  <Daviey> If we had complete confidence in upgrades, and distros switched to rolling releases.. Then this would work.  I agree.
2014-11-15T21:26:05  <mordred> lifeless: I thin that stable/ should not change transitively
2014-11-15T21:26:19  <Daviey> lifeless: BTW, in the ops summit. There were a bunch of hands that said they were using stable/* branches directly.
2014-11-15T21:26:22  <mordred> lifeless: largely because the python ecosystem has proven itself consistently to not be able to do it

2014-11-15T21:27:02  <lifeless> Daviey: my objection is to saying that we should tie everything down, because we know e.g. kernels have to change to support new hardware

2014-11-15T21:29:07  <lifeless> mordred: I think saying that configuration X is known to work is valuable; but thats a lesser statement than 'will only work with' which is what we seem to be saying
2014-11-15T21:29:21  <Daviey> Sorry, talking without context.  Initally there were plans to swap out the kernel from under users to a newer version
2014-11-15T21:29:34  <Daviey> I was omgwtfno.
2014-11-15T21:30:44  <lifeless> ok, https://github.com/testing-cabal/testtools/pull/123 is now green
2014-11-15T21:30:53  <lifeless> I'm going to JFDI to unbreak things. Fingers crossed.
2014-11-15T21:31:43  <Daviey> Regarding upper-pinning for no good reason.  This bit me recently, when I was stuck with a version of kerberos, and requests-kerberos had a no-good-reason pinning
2014-11-15T21:31:46  <Daviey> https://github.com/requests/requests-kerberos/issues/37
2014-11-15T21:32:09  <Daviey> So, upper-pinning does suck.  But for stable/* i kinda think it is the best thing
2014-11-15T21:35:27  *** dimsum__ has quit IRC
2014-11-15T21:35:52  <lifeless> Daviey: why?
2014-11-15T21:36:04  <lifeless> Daviey: what risk is it addressing that is unique to stable/* ?
2014-11-15T21:36:21  <lifeless> [if its not unique to stable/*, we should address it globally, since folk deploy master directly too...]
2014-11-15T21:36:47  *** dimsum__ has joined #openstack-infra
2014-11-15T21:37:50  <Daviey> lifeless: The upperpinning proposed is the latest version on pypi.  Therefore, for Master it would essentially be an unbounced check - unless CI had found it not to work.
2014-11-15T21:38:05  <Daviey> So by that theory, I agree... It could make sense to upper-pin from the outset.
2014-11-15T21:38:26  <lifeless> Daviey: or to not pin at all :)
2014-11-15T21:39:01  <lifeless> ok, time to context switch
2014-11-15T21:39:02  <Daviey> The issue on stable/* is that we are chasing broken newer versions constantly, both in other upstreams and openstack native projects
2014-11-15T21:40:11  <foobio> Daviey: problem there is you're expecting <X on some requirement to have the effect of pip refusing to install >=X
2014-11-15T21:40:25  <foobio> Daviey: pip doesn't work that way
2014-11-15T21:40:31  <Daviey> lifeless: BTW, I am going to quote you with the idea of coming up with the idea of upper bound'ing Master. :)
2014-11-15T21:40:48  <lifeless> Daviey: troll :)
2014-11-15T21:41:19  <Daviey> foobio: It doesn't??
2014-11-15T21:41:20  <foobio> Daviey: in fantasy land where none of our dependencies have dependencies on things we depend on, it would work out
2014-11-15T21:41:42  <Daviey> That is ok, just bring everything into stackforge. :)
2014-11-15T21:41:53  <lifeless> blanket statement time
2014-11-15T21:42:12  <lifeless> any strategy that depends on changing the behaviour of other projects transitively is very likely to fail
2014-11-15T21:42:25  <lifeless> 'make other projects release good API compatible code' is one such strategy
2014-11-15T21:42:45  <lifeless> pinning just our direct dependencies is equivalent to 'make other projects release good API compatible code'
2014-11-15T21:42:56  * foobio boils the ocean to make tea
2014-11-15T21:43:08  <Daviey> I don't think anyone is suggesting changing other projects?
2014-11-15T21:43:40  <lifeless> if we can show that what we're trying is equivalent to that, it should be a warning flag
2014-11-15T21:43:52  <lifeless> at the moment we don't list transitive deps in requirements.txt
2014-11-15T21:44:10  <foobio> Daviey: A depends on B<X and C, C depends on B>X, pip will install B>X when you ask it to install A
2014-11-15T21:44:23  <lifeless> the proposal to pin everything *in requirements.txt* doesn't change behaviour for anything transitively depended on
2014-11-15T21:44:29  <Daviey> lifeless: If $project does a release that either Master or stable/* have not prepared for, gating its support keeps the project flowing - whilst we have a measurable list of requirements we known to be broken that we can fix openstack code for (or just keep the block)
2014-11-15T21:44:46  <lifeless> which means our stability is dependent on the deps of our deps not breaking anything every
2014-11-15T21:45:00  <Daviey> foobio: I am struggling to parse your line myself. :)
2014-11-15T21:45:06  <foobio> Daviey: so is pip
2014-11-15T21:45:35  <Daviey> Ah.. penny has dropped.  We'd still have a regressive story.
2014-11-15T21:45:45  <foobio> Daviey: stated differently, pip sees a list of dependencies as a recursive task list, it does not digest the entirely of all dependencies and determine a way to solve them
2014-11-15T21:45:48  * Daviey drops lifeless idea of pinning stuff in Master

2014-11-15T21:47:01  * foobio gives up on typing and finds beer
2014-11-15T21:47:02  <lifeless> we'd still need to start listing everything in requirements.txt

2014-11-15T22:56:35  <foobio> Daviey: since that's the only place that job runs
2014-11-15T22:56:56  <Daviey> Ah good.  We probably don't need to panic a fix in then!
2014-11-15T22:57:30  <Daviey> foobio: I started looking at oslo.messaging|middleware in devstack.. but I didn't like what i was doing.
2014-11-15T22:57:30  <foobio> i'm all for less panic and doing something more fun with the rest of my weekend
2014-11-15T23:02:01  <foobio> ugh. tempest.scenario.test_baremetal_basic_ops.BaremetalBasicOps.test_baremetal_server_ops is flaky and times out. we might want to switch check-tempest-dsvm-ironic-pxe_ssh-nv back to non-voting on devstack changes
