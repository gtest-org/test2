2015-02-19T00:01:26  <foobio> hey whaddyaknow, ironic py27 passes and runs db migrations for mysql and postgresql
2015-02-19T00:01:50  <clarkb> woot
2015-02-19T00:01:53  <foobio> i guess i _could_ just drop the db_name param from the mysql-db and pgsql-db macros in that case
2015-02-19T00:02:06  <foobio> simplifies things nicely
2015-02-19T00:02:32  <foobio> also tested neutron and cinder. they check out without needing anything additional beyond what i install for nova
2015-02-19T00:02:46  <foobio> i expect ceilo to be a little on the special side tho
2015-02-19T00:03:09  <foobio> running it now
2015-02-19T00:03:17  <foobio> i should probably try some random clients too
2015-02-19T00:03:28  <foobio> though those don't need the db
2015-02-19T00:03:37  <foobio> but would be a good exercise of teh package set
2015-02-19T00:03:38  <clarkb> ya clients shouldn't need the db, just lxml

2015-02-19T00:31:05  <clarkb> thats just a feature that JJB supports but not something we use. that plugin has a global lock in the jenkins master so each job is serially processed one after the other

2015-02-19T00:58:51  <clarkb> ianw: and you can have mutiple entries for image -> provider from multiple labels. one example is the case of our 2 node envs they use the same images as our single node envs

2015-02-19T02:20:23  <arosen1> Hi I was wondering if anyone could tell me why my CI is going to pypi.python.org and pypi.dfw.opentack.org here: http://logs2.aaronorosen.com/01/157201/4/check/dsvm-tempest-full-congress-nodepool/ab67d5f/logs/devstacklog.txt.gz#_2015-02-19_02_11_21_174
2015-02-19T02:20:51  <arosen1> In my nodepool configurations I don't see any more references to pypi.dfw
2015-02-19T02:21:28  <clarkb> arosen1: depending on how old your images are puppet sets up pypi.dfw as a default
2015-02-19T02:21:36  <clarkb> I don't know why pypi.python.org is also used yet

2015-02-19T02:26:57  <arosen1> clarkb:  hrm one thing i'm wondering is why  i only have one dib image here : http://paste.openstack.org/show/177304/
2015-02-19T02:27:07  *** ghostpl_ has quit IRC
2015-02-19T02:27:57  <arosen1> clarkb:  when I added this new provider it didn't create a dib image just a normal image though it's the same config as the other provider
2015-02-19T02:28:32  <clarkb> arosen1: ya the idea is you can use a single dib image
2015-02-19T02:29:00  <arosen1> clarkb:  okay let me delete the dib image and have it rebuild it and see if that fixes this.
2015-02-19T02:29:27  <clarkb> arosen1: this way you don' do a couple hundred image builds a day like us :) also you get better consistency across providers
2015-02-19T02:30:09  *** armax has quit IRC
2015-02-19T02:31:40  <arosen1> clarkb:  ah okay i see so you don't build a new dib image for multiple providers.
2015-02-19T02:31:56  <clarkb> nope, it does mean a few things get a little weird but overall its been a big win
2015-02-19T02:31:59  <arosen1> i went to update the image but i created a new provider to do so and i guess it pushed the same image.
2015-02-19T02:32:15  <arosen1> I added a new provider only because there is this gluster bug in our cloud
2015-02-19T02:32:19  <clarkb> ya it will upload the same qcow2
2015-02-19T02:32:26  <arosen1> cool thanks hopefully this will fix it.

2015-02-19T02:50:25  <arosen1> clarkb:  quick question. Rebuilding the image im seeing this error: INFO nodepool.image.build.devstack-trusty-dib: [ERROR] /tmp/image.ZsWcsDJr/mnt/opt/git/openstack-dev/devstack/stackrc:665 Could not determine host ip address. See local.conf for suggestions on setting HOST_IP.
2015-02-19T02:50:52  <clarkb> arosen1: I think there is a patch up to devstack to avoid that problem
2015-02-19T02:51:04  <clarkb> arosen1: otherwise check the HOST_IP stuff that devstack is looking for
2015-02-19T02:51:16  <arosen1> clarkb:  how do i set that for nodepool dib?
2015-02-19T02:51:38  <clarkb> arosen1: it will depend on what DEVSTACK is looking for
2015-02-19T02:51:42  <clarkb> er devstack
2015-02-19T02:52:23  *** dims_ has quit IRC
2015-02-19T02:52:49  <clarkb> its just a chroot so its your build node's interfaces that it iwll be looking at

2015-02-19T02:53:18  <clarkb> arosen1: yes, one of the things nodepool does is ask devstack for a list of files to cache. When it does that devstack expects to be able to determine your ip address
2015-02-19T02:53:43  *** cody-somerville has joined #openstack-infra
2015-02-19T02:53:44  <clarkb> arosen1: this is unnecessary for the functionality so there is a patch to devstack to stop requiring that, but as a workaround you just need to have devstack be able to determine the host's ip address
2015-02-19T02:54:12  <arosen1> clarkb: okay let me see want i need to do to make that happen.
2015-02-19T02:54:16  <arosen1> thanks.

2015-02-19T08:53:25  <deepakcs> AJaeger, you seem to +2 it.. myself and BharatK are working on the glusterfs job. We are not clear on what 'partway' in the commit msg mean ?
2015-02-19T08:53:43  <AJaeger> deepakcs, just check the experimental queue at http://status.openstack.org/zuul/
2015-02-19T08:53:51  <deepakcs> AJaeger, ok.. checking now
2015-02-19T08:53:58  *** teran_ has joined #openstack-infra
2015-02-19T08:54:07  <AJaeger> there'S a job running for 40+ hours - and that because of glusterfs
2015-02-19T08:55:49  <deepakcs> AJaeger, is it bcos of 'check experimental' in https://review.openstack.org/152401 ?
2015-02-19T08:56:07  * deepakcs still trying to understand why it would take 40+ hours. local tempest runs go fine
2015-02-19T08:56:07  <AJaeger> deepakcs, also scrollback or read the public logs http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/%23openstack-infra/%23openstack-infra.2015-02-19.log for details

2015-02-19T08:57:20  <AJaeger> deepakcs, as said in the commit message: This comes from "check experimental" and somehow the glusterfs job stops in the middle and then gets restarted - in an endless loop
2015-02-19T08:57:55  <AJaeger> We can't have that ;( Please talk with clarkb or foobio at US time again on how to fix this.
2015-02-19T08:58:32  <deepakcs> AJaeger, i read the logs, it says its failign in the object tests

2015-02-19T09:00:09  <AJaeger> deepakcs, there're ways to limit what tempest tests are run, check what other jobs do - in project-config/jenkins/jobs/*
2015-02-19T09:00:20  <deepakcs> AJaeger, thanks, will do

2015-02-19T09:08:01  <AJaeger> deepakcs, once you're sure everything is working as it should, we can enable the test again

2015-02-19T09:08:19  <deepakcs> AJaeger, you mean https://review.openstack.org/#/c/141424/ is running for 40+ hours. I am still trying to understand how is that related to glusterfs job
2015-02-19T09:08:41  <AJaeger> deepakcs, look at http://status.openstack.org/zuul/
2015-02-19T09:08:49  <AJaeger> 141424 is the first change
2015-02-19T09:09:02  <AJaeger> If you monitor the glusterfs job, you see it'S the only job that has not passed
2015-02-19T09:09:34  <AJaeger> And if you look at it over time, you see that it runs for a long time - and then starts again, as just now
2015-02-19T09:10:03  *** dizquierdo has joined #openstack-infra
2015-02-19T09:10:32  <AJaeger> I can't help you debug why this happens - but what happens is that the glusterfs job suddenly dies and then zuul starts it again and again and again - now since 40 hours.
2015-02-19T09:11:02  <deepakcs> AJaeger, i see 141424 change, but what do I need to do to monitor glusterfs job ? The zuul links points me back to the patch
2015-02-19T09:11:35  <AJaeger> deepakcs, check the link of the glusterfs job, it's currently: https://jenkins07.openstack.org/job/check-tempest-dsvm-full-glusterfs-centos7/36/
2015-02-19T09:11:49  <AJaeger> Or check one of the others - each glusterfs job is a link

2015-02-19T09:14:47  <deepakcs> AJaeger, thanks, looking at that.. new to jenkins/infra... so trying to make my way to the error. I still haven't been able to see the actual error on the node that causes zuul to think its gone and hence restartsit
2015-02-19T09:15:17  <AJaeger> deepakcs, there are more experimental glusterfs jobs running if you need more data ;)
2015-02-19T09:16:03  <deepakcs> AJaeger, yeah i am still a bit lost on what exactly is happening inside the job. Shall i just start from the jenkins dashboard to get a list of all experimental glustefs jobs ?
2015-02-19T09:16:04  <AJaeger> deepakcs, you might need to discuss with clarkb and foobio later today (US time - so UTC 15:00 or later).
2015-02-19T09:16:18  <deepakcs> AJaeger, ok will do
2015-02-19T09:16:36  <AJaeger> start from the zuul page - we have several jenkins running and zuul is the best way to guide you

2015-02-19T15:00:11  <deepakcs> anteaya, well it says IO Excp and below the original excp seems to be EOF, but not sure why or how is it related to glusterfs devstack job
2015-02-19T15:00:38  <deepakcs> anteaya, wondering in infra has seen such things before for any other job/scenario from where we can get some clues
2015-02-19T15:00:50  <anteaya> well since it occurs due to the addition of your job are you willing to consider that it might in fact be a result of your job and start there?
2015-02-19T15:01:32  <deepakcs> anteaya, there are around 30+ glustefs experimental jobs that have failed and they don't fail at the same testcase, its random, so can't tie it to the testcase running at failure too

2015-02-19T15:11:01  <deepakcs> BobBall, ok, so does it mean something in the job is causing it to lose SSH connectivity ?

2015-02-19T15:11:42  <BobBall> If it's reproducible, perhaps, yes.  Otherwise might be some random cloudy thing that caused that node to die

2015-02-19T15:12:17  <deepakcs> BobBall, most of the jobs there are aborted due to this java excp
2015-02-19T15:12:36  <deepakcs> BobBall, and few due to build timeout error
2015-02-19T15:12:39  <foobio> deepakcs: so, there are two prime possibilities for what was happening with that job

2015-02-19T15:13:39  <foobio> deepakcs: either something is making network configuration changes (routing, interface reconfiguration, firewall rules, et cetera) which are causing the jenkins master to no longer be able to reach teh worker, or something is causing a kernel panic (maybe something filesystem-related?)
2015-02-19T15:14:17  <foobio> deepakcs: can you attempt to recreate the situation on virtual machines of your own to identify the problem?

2015-02-19T15:16:25  <deepakcs> foobio, 2 days back the job was running fine (~2 hours to complete as its a full test), but were failing 2 testcases, we added a change to allow nova policy for online snap, post which we are seeing this
2015-02-19T15:16:52  <foobio> deepakcs: another possibility is an out-of-memory condition which is causing the kernel to kill lots of processes on the worker and also happens to blow out the jenkins slave agent in the process... is it possible this job would require more than 8gb ram?
2015-02-19T15:16:58  <deepakcs> foobio, with the same change on a local VM, we don't see that issue

2015-02-19T15:18:08  <deepakcs> foobio, since it says EOF excp (if u follow the caused by in java excp) i was wondering if its running out of disk space ?
2015-02-19T15:18:12  <foobio> so that's probably not the issue then
2015-02-19T15:18:14  <anteaya> AJaeger: ah okay thanks
2015-02-19T15:18:17  *** dims__ has joined #openstack-infra
2015-02-19T15:18:22  <AJaeger> anteaya, correct
2015-02-19T15:18:29  <foobio> deepakcs: do you need more than 20gb disk?
2015-02-19T15:18:51  <deepakcs> BharatK, locally whats ur disk size ?
2015-02-19T15:18:56  <BharatK> foobio, in the local environment I am using 40 GB
2015-02-19T15:19:29  <clarkb> also note we run the "full" tempest run not a subset
2015-02-19T15:19:32  <BharatK> foobio, while job is running I have seen the 34GB free space in "df -h" output
2015-02-19T15:19:36  <deepakcs> BharatK, foobio  but the max we do is create a loop device of 8G using the disk file to be used as a brick for glusterfs storage, so 20G should be sufficient
2015-02-19T15:19:49  <clarkb> so you may not see this locally if running a subset
2015-02-19T15:19:50  <deepakcs> clarkb, hi
2015-02-19T15:19:52  <foobio> jenkins will automatically offline the worker if its root filesystem fills up, but it also often misreports a full filesystem as the reason for offlining when in actuality it loses contact with the worker, so that tends to be a false error
2015-02-19T15:20:25  <foobio> deepakcs: do you create it in /opt or somewhere else? we do have hundreds of gb in /opt generally but / can be as small as 20gb
2015-02-19T15:20:30  <BharatK> clarkb, In local environment we ran full tempest
2015-02-19T15:20:32  <deepakcs> BharatK, u did run "full" tempest too, and it ran fine, right ?
2015-02-19T15:20:53  <BharatK> deepakcs, just one hour back I ran full tempest without any issues.
2015-02-19T15:21:04  <deepakcs> BharatK, can u answer foobio 's q on where we create the 8G disk file ?
2015-02-19T15:21:29  <deepakcs> foobio, looking at the console logs, before the tests start, df -h shows 32G as free space for root
2015-02-19T15:21:58  <clarkb> BobBall you put your swift creds in zuul's ini file then zuul generates the job specific creds
2015-02-19T15:21:59  <deepakcs> foobio,  /dev/xvda1       40G  5.9G   32G  16% /
2015-02-19T15:22:17  <BharatK> foobio, we are creating loopback device in /var/lib/glance
2015-02-19T15:22:19  <BobBall> oh brilliant clarkb *looks* thanks.
2015-02-19T15:22:41  <foobio> deepakcs: yeah, some have 40 and some 20 depending on what provider they end up running in (we have virtual machines from a couple different service providers)
2015-02-19T15:22:42  <BharatK> foobio, /var/lib/glusterfs/
2015-02-19T15:22:45  <clarkb> BobBall those creds are scoped to the container and path and have anexpiry iirc
2015-02-19T15:23:03  <deepakcs> foobio, i don't see /opt as a diff mnt in the df -h
2015-02-19T15:23:09  <deepakcs> so /opt is part of / itself
2015-02-19T15:23:29  <clarkb> that df likely runs before the mount then
2015-02-19T15:23:39  <clarkb> see the setup host log
2015-02-19T15:23:44  <foobio> we might want to see if we can fix the ordering there at some point
2015-02-19T15:24:00  <clarkb> we carve out the ephemeral drive and mount swap and /opt
2015-02-19T15:24:14  <deepakcs> clarkb, ok, setup host log can be seen only if the job completed gracefully, right ?

2015-02-19T15:25:37  <deepakcs> clarkb, foobio since we are not able to recreate this in local VM is it possible to somehow enable this job, but not come in the queue for others, so that we can debug with some ideas ?
2015-02-19T15:27:01  <clarkb> foobio no I didnt get that far. it was ever job running yesterday though so I would be suprised if it wasnt both

2015-02-19T15:27:12  <foobio> deepakcs: i can try to rerun the job by hand as long as i know which provider i'm likely to trigger the failure scenario in
2015-02-19T15:27:21  <deepakcs> clarkb, foobio Other than the java excp , the only other error i saw was "build timeout / aborted" - what does that signify ? jenkins server timedout connecting to slave ?

2015-02-19T15:33:04  <deepakcs> clarkb, foobio is it a bad idea to add the job again and we do some debug (Like limit the tests to volume only, reduce the size of loop device etc )?

2015-02-19T15:33:49  <deepakcs> clarkb, foobio or add it to a different expt pipeline so that it doesn't affect others ?
2015-02-19T15:34:15  <clarkb> foobio a while back, just devstack/temlest failed on them but the nodes themselves were ok
2015-02-19T15:34:46  <foobio> oh, got it. so as long as they're not running devstack/tempest on centos7 their job should work i guess?
2015-02-19T15:34:53  <deepakcs> foobio,  i just randonly checked 4-5 jobs and all had 'rax' in the hostname
2015-02-19T15:35:20  <foobio> because it sort of sounds like they're trying to set up devstack and run tempest against it on centos7 there
2015-02-19T15:35:25  <clarkb> foobio it is a tempest job but the other centos7 jobs dont die like this they fail normally

2015-02-19T15:39:41  <clarkb> deepakcs no I think we figure this one out
2015-02-19T15:39:45  <mugsie> is there a problem allowing us to have the third party ci?
2015-02-19T15:40:03  <anteaya> do you need to have third party ci?
2015-02-19T15:40:13  <mugsie> we don;t have a massive immediate need, but I want to try running a few other job against our patches
2015-02-19T15:40:17  <mugsie> jobs*
2015-02-19T15:40:19  <anteaya> I'm feeling is is a fashion statement rather than something folks need
2015-02-19T15:40:27  <deepakcs> clarkb, foobio thanks in advance :) Do we shar eour email IDs with you so that you can keep us in the loop (given the TZ diff, we will be asleep soon) :)
2015-02-19T15:40:32  <mugsie> and we will eventually need it (in the next cycle or so)
2015-02-19T15:40:41  <anteaya> mugsie: you can run a few jobs against your patches
2015-02-19T15:40:52  <anteaya> and you can have the ci systems comment on your patches
2015-02-19T15:40:53  <mugsie> but not vote

2015-02-19T15:42:33  <mugsie> it can take code coverage as well

2015-02-19T15:45:12  <deepakcs> foobio, ok, will start a thread on -infra, hope that is fine ?
2015-02-19T15:45:29  <clarkb> yes that would be good
2015-02-19T15:45:32  <foobio> deepakcs: i would say start one on openstack-dev@lists.openstack.org instead
2015-02-19T15:45:39  <foobio> but infra will work if you'd rather
2015-02-19T15:45:39  <clarkb> or there
2015-02-19T15:45:46  <mugsie> foobio: yeah. but if left as a long running thing it gives interesting trends etc
2015-02-19T15:46:01  <clarkb> actually ya -dev will get more eyes on it and maybe other will recognize the behavior
2015-02-19T15:46:01  <deepakcs> i thought infra was more appropriate for this
2015-02-19T15:46:05  <foobio> mugsie: oh, so it's not a testing tool, it's a trending tool?
2015-02-19T15:46:28  <foobio> deepakcs: infra is more appropriate for topics which are not of interest to openstack, but you're testing openstack with glusterfs, right?
2015-02-19T15:46:39  <mugsie> it can do both. Its can give an incremental report, and then keep track of results over time
2015-02-19T15:46:46  <deepakcs> foobio, yes

2015-02-19T15:49:36  <foobio> mugsie: in that case as anteaya says you don't need a -ci group for that. it's only to be able to control what accounts can leave code verification votes on proposed changes
2015-02-19T15:50:27  <foobio> mugsie: any account can listen to the event stream, which is all you need to be able to see the change-merged events

2015-02-19T16:12:00  <foobio> mugsie: so it's not just your project. pretty much any project which requests something should expect to have to justify their request

2015-02-19T16:19:41  <pcrews> clarkb: sure - just shot for a high value to ensure it would pass (or if it doesn't run in 90 min, it needs more tlc imo) - do you have an opinion / recommendation for time?

2015-02-19T16:20:46  <clarkb> pcrews: no immediate opinion, but usually if jobs start timing out over time we are straddling the boundary and don't need a large jump. maybe just bump to 50-60 minutes?
2015-02-19T16:21:32  *** otter768 has quit IRC
2015-02-19T16:21:32  <foobio> pcrews: the general rule of thumb is that if you allow that job to run for 90 minutes instead of only 40 then it will _very_soon_ start taking 90 minutes instead of only 40
2015-02-19T16:22:09  <pcrews> foobio: ack and noted ;)
2015-02-19T16:22:15  <foobio> because the only pushback on whether tests are poorly-written and take too long is when they start causing the job to time out

2015-02-19T17:24:37  <foobio> but i sort of like the idea that installing the module gives you a working _something_ you can then proceed to extend as needed
2015-02-19T17:24:44  <clarkb> or maybe ship a manifest that you can include that uses some relatively sane defaults but otherwise doesn't force you into using it

2015-02-19T17:40:24  <BobBall> OK - one more question... When running a job kicked by zuul, jenkins does offline my node, but nodepool doesn't delete it.  It doesn't seem to go into the Used state either, just sits there "Ready".  Any ideas?
2015-02-19T17:40:26  <zaro> sigmavirus24: me too
2015-02-19T17:40:37  <clarkb> zaro: by default /p is served by gerrit itself so the normal proxying to gerrit makes /p work. However for us we want /p to bypass gerrit and hit the git repo replica on /var/lib/git. This requirse running a git cgi script so apache needs to be told that it is ok to do that

2015-02-19T18:37:26  <bcourt> this might be a silly question, how does nodepool validate that an image built correctly?  Is it checking the return code of the prepare node script?
2015-02-19T18:39:23  <clarkb> bcourt: it has two bits that do that. First is image building where it checks the return code of the prepare node script. Second is the ready node script which it runs post boot and also checks the return code on
2015-02-19T18:39:44  <clarkb> bcourt: so if nodeool cannot ssh into a node and subsequently run whatever ready script it has successfully that node will be deleted and a new one booted

2015-02-19T19:17:55  <TravT_> where everybody comes together for several hours on code reviews
2015-02-19T19:18:12  <TravT_> and the patches that need a couple of requirements are coming up.

2015-02-19T19:34:20  <otherwiseguy> neutron has a notifier that uses novaclient
2015-02-19T19:35:13  <BobBall> What should be setting nodepool nodes to USED?  Zuul successfully runs a job on a node, but it's not transitioning to USED then to deleting - presumably because the onStarted messages aren't sent and/or received, but I don't see where they are sent from and why they might not be being sent.

2015-02-19T20:09:33  <mordred> that is then consumed by running openstackclient
2015-02-19T20:09:35  <mordred> nope
2015-02-19T20:09:39  <mordred> you run openstackclient
2015-02-19T20:09:40  <vipul> essentially it allows you to run 'openstack <your plugin command>'
2015-02-19T20:09:45  <foobio> er
2015-02-19T20:09:48  <mordred> but if you install the cueclient plugin, you get more commands in openstackclient
2015-02-19T20:09:58  <mordred> so openstackclient doesn't depend on it
2015-02-19T20:10:07  <mordred> but cueclient is useless without openstackclient
2015-02-19T20:10:13  <foobio> i mean, the same could be said of any optional dependency i guess
2015-02-19T20:10:16  <mordred> yes
2015-02-19T20:10:43  <mordred> it's like "apt-get install firefox-plugin-lightning" which you'd expect to wind up also installing firefox if it's not installed
2015-02-19T20:11:17  <vipul> mordred: great example !
2015-02-19T20:12:23  <foobio> yep, that analogy works
2015-02-19T20:12:38  <vipul> shall i submit a patch? foobio
2015-02-19T20:13:00  <foobio> so this goes back to the "should we include dependencies only requested by stackforge projects in the openstack projects global requirements list?" debate

2015-02-19T20:19:07  <foobio> yeah, REQUIREMENTS_MODE defaults to "strict" in devstack-gate but can be overridden from the calling environment, and then passes that into devstack which also defaults to "strict" but bypasses that extra requirements check if it's "soft" instead
2015-02-19T20:19:37  <foobio> however i don't see any current jobs passing that into devstack-gate, in theory it's an implemented and working feature

2015-02-19T20:59:24  <clarkb> foobio: ya but pylint also points out a lot of things that aren't issues
2015-02-19T20:59:32  <clarkb> its false positive rate is incredibly high
2015-02-19T20:59:34  <BobBall> foobio: Did you get to the bottom of the EOF issue from earlier?  I'm hitting it too on my Ubuntu nodes - testing with Xen.  During the devstack setup script it dies

2015-02-19T21:00:01  <foobio> and also to achieve that deeper analysis it has to do things like import modules outside of normal python mechanisms

2015-02-19T21:02:56  <BobBall> Also interesting I just noticed that nodepool failed to kill the nodes that seem to be dying... saying they don't exist.  Which sound highly fatal and interesting to me...
2015-02-19T21:03:14  *** sdake_ has joined #openstack-infra
2015-02-19T21:03:32  <clarkb> supposedly jmap comes from the jdk, we must only install jre. I am confirming that. There is an option to have signal 3 create a heap dump which I may enable post restart for next time this happens
2015-02-19T21:03:35  <foobio> i started devstack-gate at 16:01:57 and the kernel killed mysqld at 18:47:08 so that may have been unrelated breakage after the fact
2015-02-19T21:03:51  <BobBall> ah no - I misread the log - it was the node in jenkins that had disappeared

2015-02-19T21:04:51  <clarkb> ya we install the openjdk-7-jre-headless package so no jmap. My vote is for not doing a heap dump today, but add the flag to the jvm that will do a heap dump on signal 3 when we restart gerrit
2015-02-19T21:04:56  <clarkb> I will write the puppet change for that now
2015-02-19T21:05:25  <foobio> ahh, nope, timing works out. mysqld oom'd about 4 seconds before the devstack-gate-cleanup-host.txt log starts
2015-02-19T21:06:01  <BobBall> Ah - yes.  I bet mine is an OOM too.

2015-02-19T21:49:27  <jhesketh> clarkb: no worries, all good :-). Maybe there's something I could help with?
2015-02-19T21:50:08  <clarkb> jhesketh: it appears that gerrit 2.8 has a memory leak. I have discovered that there are in theory options to the jvm that will cause it to dump a heap dump on signal 3
2015-02-19T21:50:19  <clarkb> but applying those options to review-dev makes gerrit daemon not start
2015-02-19T21:50:42  <clarkb> my current plan is to figure out how to run gerrit with those options so that after we restart to kill the current leak we have debugging options fr next time

2015-02-19T21:54:55  <clarkb> jhesketh: since its relatively low overhead for me to start a job and hold a node
2015-02-19T21:55:51  <clarkb> ok HeapDumpOnCtrlBreak is an unrecognized option

2015-02-19T21:57:01  <clarkb> jhesketh: well I think I am about to give up on this. I think our only other option is to install the jdk instead of jre to get jmap
2015-02-19T21:59:30  <clarkb> foobio: what do you think about just restarting gerrit now? then we can worry about switching to a jdk install later?

2015-02-19T23:08:08  <ekarlso> dtroyer: rly, why ?
2015-02-19T23:08:15  <dtroyer> because nothing 'should' depend on it
2015-02-19T23:08:16  <clarkb> jhesketh: I just rechecked a change and will hold a couple nodes from that
2015-02-19T23:08:29  <clarkb> jhesketh: should runwith the 4 hour expiry
2015-02-19T23:08:38  <dtroyer> apparently a couple of clients with OSC plugins do though.  I'd argue that they should not so that as it is really optional
2015-02-19T23:08:59  <ekarlso> dtroyer: isn't openstackclient the way to go for cli forwards kinda ?
2015-02-19T23:09:08  <jhesketh> clarkb: thanks :-)
2015-02-19T23:09:09  <foobio> ekarlso: if python-cueclient is a stackforge project, it can use the REQUIREMENTS_MODE=soft option to devstack-gate/devstack allowing it to install additional requirements which aren't in the global requirements list
2015-02-19T23:09:27  <dtroyer> if you just want the congressclient libs, you would otherwise have to install OSC and _all_ of its dependencies, which may not be what you want
2015-02-19T23:10:09  <foobio> dtroyer: the counterargument from congressclient and cueclient is "i want to pip install this thing that's a plugin to openstackclient, so it should automatically install openstackclient for me when i do"
2015-02-19T23:10:18  <dtroyer> IOW, OSC and the various client lins with OSC plugins should not have each other in their requirements as they are both useful without the other
2015-02-19T23:10:31  <clarkb> jhesketh: do you think I/we should add better logging to the threadpull change? we should be able to use python's logging lib to get synchronized log writes across the threads

2015-02-19T23:16:21  <clarkb> jhesketh: so just '14400' unless the swift stuff needs it as an int
2015-02-19T23:16:44  <jhesketh> clarkb: looking at swift.py there is int(time() + settings['expiry']), so I'm not sure if a string will screw that up
2015-02-19T23:16:57  <jhesketh> or if the layout stuff reads it in as an int
2015-02-19T23:17:16  <foobio> yeah, i think without wrapping like int(settings['expiry']) that will asplode
2015-02-19T23:17:16  <clarkb> oh then ya we should revert

2015-02-19T23:18:29  <clarkb> so I think a better way to handle this is where the exception is thrown coerce to a string first

2015-02-19T23:25:02  <anteaya> as opposed to an infra repo
2015-02-19T23:25:12  <foobio> anteaya: because it's a nova job?
2015-02-19T23:25:45  <clarkb> jhesketh: I see
2015-02-19T23:26:12  <foobio> anteaya: selecting nova as probably one of the more complex/needy projects from a unit testing perspective (exercises database configuration on the worker as well as some system package expectations)
2015-02-19T23:26:26  <anteaya> foobio: but that is just the title of it, right? there is nothing else that is specific to nova, is there?

2015-02-19T23:26:43  <jhesketh> clarkb: although expires is substituted into the string with %s which is surprising
2015-02-19T23:26:49  <anteaya> I just wasn't seeing anything nova specific
2015-02-19T23:26:57  <jhesketh> if you're fixing that up, it should probably be %d
2015-02-19T23:26:59  <foobio> anteaya: it checks out nova source code and runs tox -e py27 basically
2015-02-19T23:27:01  <anteaya> it just installs packages and sets up the dbs
2015-02-19T23:27:07  <jhesketh> clarkb: let me know if you'd prefer I made the changes
2015-02-19T23:27:10  <clarkb> jhesketh: %s basically just does str() on the thing first iirc
2015-02-19T23:27:16  <jogo> clarkb: so we broke icehouse which means d-g is wedged too

2015-02-19T23:27:44  <foobio> anteaya: the next step (whether in that same change or in a new change) will be to extend that so i can add it as several experimental jobs to basically all projects
2015-02-19T23:27:51  <clarkb> jhesketh: so I think we don't coerce in launchers/gearman then, instead maybe just only do the format() call if v is a string type?
2015-02-19T23:28:11  <clarkb> jhesketh: since there shouldn't be a reason for expiry to have that format called on it
2015-02-19T23:28:12  <jhesketh> clarkb: that was my thinking
2015-02-19T23:28:20  <jhesketh> +1
2015-02-19T23:28:25  <anteaya> foobio: okay yes in the experimental-workers.yaml
2015-02-19T23:28:33  <foobio> anteaya: but nova provides a good initial proving ground that the mechanics of the macros work (i've already tested the scripts they contain so more worried about making sure parameter substitution and worker node label selection work correctly)
2015-02-19T23:28:34  <clarkb> jhesketh: ok I have things open should have this done soon
2015-02-19T23:28:44  <anteaya> foobio: right that is what I was expecting, hence my question about nova

2015-02-19T23:29:01  <anteaya> I understand now
2015-02-19T23:29:13  <krotscheck> nibalizer: So, working on puppet-storyboard, I'm trying to figure out a good way to notify an optional module. Have you seen something like that before?
2015-02-19T23:29:40  <anteaya> I'll wait until -nova has fixed their fire
2015-02-19T23:29:44  <anteaya> then bug them
2015-02-19T23:29:50  <anteaya> the look close
2015-02-19T23:29:53  <foobio> okay, so having built a _full_ package install list from our thick slave class manifest, installing those (mostly locally cached) at job run time adds ~1m11s. once i add bindep hooks, projects can bypass that by providing a more specific bindep manifest to just install the packages they really need

2015-02-19T23:32:24  <krotscheck> nibalizer: How would I then tell service['http'] (from an extrnal module) to subscribe to something that I'm doing inside of mine?
2015-02-19T23:32:30  *** yamamoto has joined #openstack-infra
2015-02-19T23:32:32  <anteaya> foobio: makes sense
2015-02-19T23:32:55  <clarkb> oh wait the fix won't hrm

2015-02-19T23:33:15  <clarkb> foobio: jhesketh so zuul stopped running jobs so our fix won't merge :) I will stop puppet on zuul and apply by hand then reenable puppet once it goes through
2015-02-19T23:33:46  <greghaynes> clarkb: do we care about python3 in that location?
2015-02-19T23:34:08  <clarkb> greghaynes: no zuul isn't py3k friendly
2015-02-19T23:34:16  <greghaynes> ok
2015-02-19T23:34:56  <jhesketh> clarkb: if zuul stopped running jobs won't it need a manual restart?
2015-02-19T23:35:18  <clarkb> jhesketh: well its "stopped" basically was in a tight loop on that error, removing the error allowed it to continue
2015-02-19T23:35:20  <clarkb> jobs are starting now
2015-02-19T23:35:37  <clarkb> but will keep an eye on it just in case it does need a restart for some reason
2015-02-19T23:35:51  <jhesketh> oh right, puppet kept putting the bad config back in
2015-02-19T23:35:59  <clarkb> jhesketh: right
2015-02-19T23:36:05  <jhesketh> okay, sounds good then
2015-02-19T23:36:09  <clarkb> so puppet is disabled, I removed the line, and HUP'd the service
2015-02-19T23:36:19  <clarkb> once your change gets in I will reenable puppet and we should be good
2015-02-19T23:36:45  <openstackgerrit> Douglas Mendizábal proposed openstack-infra/project-config: Add a devstack-gate job to barbicanclient's tests  https://review.openstack.org/157568
2015-02-19T23:36:59  <clarkb> Deficit: devstack-trusty: 0 (start: 293 min: 293 ready: 312 capacity: 8) looks much better on the nodepool side
2015-02-19T23:37:41  <clarkb> jhesketh: I think this would happen with the global change as well
2015-02-19T23:37:51  <clarkb> so good thing we caught it just with the simple config change :)

2015-02-19T23:41:37  <clarkb> jogo: also this sort of makes my point about capping vs pinning :)
2015-02-19T23:41:40  <jhesketh> clarkb: actually I'm not sure it would because the defaults are looked up in lib/swift.py and aren't formatted

2015-02-19T23:43:31  <jogo> they broke semver
2015-02-19T23:44:31  <foobio> i guess the good semver solution would be to revert that patch, make a new micro point release, then restore it and have a version bump?
2015-02-19T23:44:41  <clarkb> jogo: I don't think they did
2015-02-19T23:44:53  <clarkb> jogo: requiring a different version of keystoneclient isn't a backward incompatible change
2015-02-19T23:44:55  <jogo> clarkb: wild dependency jumps
2015-02-19T23:45:05  <clarkb> its only becuse you have decided to pin everthing :)
2015-02-19T23:45:42  <clarkb> but I don't think that makes it a backward incompat change. Its just not compatible with how you ahve chosen to do requirements

2015-02-19T23:47:08  <foobio> i tried to embark on a similar solution for folsom/grizzly and didn't get nearly this far because we didn't have good requirements sync across projects, but could forsee even then that trying to do that given how pypi handles dep resolution was going to be fraught with peril
2015-02-19T23:47:13  <clarkb> jogo: I don't follow the leap there either
2015-02-19T23:47:23  *** dimtruck is now known as zz_dimtruck
2015-02-19T23:47:37  <jogo> clarkb: that is where OSC was pinned. which is what is breaking
2015-02-19T23:48:30  <clarkb> right but its breaking because ou have pinned keystone clietn and neutronclient did a release that didn't respect that pin
2015-02-19T23:48:51  <clarkb> which would be fine if the pins in general weren't in place
2015-02-19T23:49:03  <clarkb> anyways this is why I have been wary of the pins. I think it will lead to just as much work and pain

2015-02-19T23:49:27  <clarkb> caps on the other hand give you enough flexibility to work around with things when they shift within reason
2015-02-19T23:49:51  <jogo> clarkb: well neutron client has a cap <2.4
2015-02-19T23:49:53  <jogo> not a pin
2015-02-19T23:49:57  <jogo> same with OSC
2015-02-19T23:50:03  <krotscheck> nibalizer: ^^ is the relevant code. I'm not certain where I can fit the subscription though. Wouldn't mind your feedback
2015-02-19T23:50:03  <jogo> its not a hard '=='
2015-02-19T23:50:04  <clarkb> jogo: what about keystoneclient?
2015-02-19T23:50:10  <clarkb> keystoneclient is the thing at fault here
2015-02-19T23:50:15  <jogo> python-keystoneclient>=0.7.0,<0.12
2015-02-19T23:50:36  <jogo> clarkb: I think its safe to say there is no easy answer for any of this
2015-02-19T23:50:43  <clarkb> jogo: yes that is what I have said :)
2015-02-19T23:50:44  <tchaypo> ah, this is still going, excellent
2015-02-19T23:50:56  <clarkb> jogo: which is why I have had a preference to just deal with status quo since its all bad and least effort
2015-02-19T23:50:58  <jogo> clarkb: capped,uncapped,pinned or other

2015-02-19T23:51:34  <jogo> clarkb: this was a a status quo break. my cap all stable/juno didn't impact this
2015-02-19T23:52:23  <foobio> when i started to try, i concluded that it's really not particularly tractable even with requirements sync (which we thankfully now have) unless someone has available time to help get a smart dep solver into pip
2015-02-19T23:52:51  <clarkb> jogo: you didn't also cap/pin icehouse?

2015-02-19T23:54:05  <harlowja> https://github.com/harlowja/pippin has a few idea(s)
2015-02-19T23:54:15  <foobio> harlowja: my understanding is it just turns pip into a downloader and handles the dep resolution on its own?
2015-02-19T23:54:21  <harlowja> basically
2015-02-19T23:55:05  <foobio> sounds reasonable, though i can already see the ensuing shitstorm from "here's how you pip install openstack projects _now_"
2015-02-19T23:55:17  <harlowja> the current code in that repo uses pip for downloading, expands the full dependency graph, then creates 'requirement' trees (where each path in that tree is one solution for a requirement)

2015-02-19T23:56:17  <clarkb> honestly the right place to fix this *is* pip
2015-02-19T23:56:28  <clarkb> because you will install other python things too
2015-02-19T23:56:38  <foobio> i mean, we're already partway there with declaring that we just don't support easy_install, so saying you can't use straight pip to install this stuff either is only likely to alienate the remaining parts of the python community we haven't already
