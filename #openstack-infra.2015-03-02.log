2015-03-02T10:09:38  <mrmartin> AJaeger hi
2015-03-02T10:09:47  <mrmartin> can you give me a review on this: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/159426/
2015-03-02T10:09:50  <AJaeger> hi mrmartin
2015-03-02T10:10:19  <mrmartin> The groups portal cron jobs are broken for a while, and this patch resolves that issue
2015-03-02T10:10:32  <AJaeger> mrmartin, I'm not a core there and don't know enough to review it.
2015-03-02T10:10:38  <mrmartin> if you give me a +1 it is enough
2015-03-02T10:10:45  <mrmartin> it is easier to manage a +2 at the end
2015-03-02T10:10:54  <AJaeger> Let me check whether it looks sane...
2015-03-02T10:11:07  *** salv-orlando has quit IRC
2015-03-02T10:11:08  <mrmartin> it is a very simple patch
2015-03-02T10:11:23  <mrmartin> just a puppet variable changed
2015-03-02T10:11:39  <AJaeger> looks sane, +1
2015-03-02T10:11:52  <mrmartin> thanks
2015-03-02T10:12:10  <mrmartin> don't we have an infra core in EU timezone?

2015-03-02T10:22:30  <mrmartin> deepakcs, sorry I don't have experience with that, if you cannot find anyone in actual timezone, need to wait until the US fellas wake up

2015-03-02T11:43:48  <AJaeger> bookwar, one of the infra cores needs to do this - let's ask clarkb or pleia2 once they're awake (US time) for this. Could you give me the email address of NIkolay, please?
2015-03-02T11:44:53  <bookwar> AJaeger: he is the author of the original commit, Nikolay Markov <nmarkov AT mirantis.com>
2015-03-02T11:45:37  <AJaeger> bookwar, thanks. I hope pleia2 and clarkb scroll back once they're back ^ - if not, please ping again later today

2015-03-02T15:38:11  <timrc> jeblair, clarkb, fungi, mordred and whomever else... just a random question about nodepool and is probably a product of my naivety... why do we go through the trouble of complete tear-down / build-up of nodes in nodepool? In other words, why don't we use "rebuild" to avoid costly delete operations to reset VMs?  All else be equal (in terms of required resources and what not) then simply re-imaging an existing VM seems to be a much quicker solutio
2015-03-02T15:38:11  <timrc> n than deleting everything and then recreating it with a different image.
2015-03-02T15:38:34  <mordred> timrc: we have a todo list item to use rebuild
2015-03-02T15:38:47  * timrc beams.  Yay.
2015-03-02T15:38:55  <mordred> timrc: but it'll take some work in the scheduler, since the delete and create threads are separeate right now

2015-03-02T15:45:06  <jeblair> timrc: it's going to be a big enough change it should have a spec beforehand; it might want to wait until the big nodepool work i have proposed on the list.  also, we should test that using rebuild is actually faster and benchmark it.
2015-03-02T15:45:48  <pashkin> Hi all! Can somebody explain, why Jenkins jobs configs stored in separate repository and not in propjects repositories themselves?
2015-03-02T15:45:49  <timrc> jeblair, I think I have quite a bit of work to do learning about nodepool before I tackle anything, so yeah...
2015-03-02T15:46:29  <mordred> jeblair: ++ to testing
2015-03-02T15:46:43  <mordred> jeblair, timrc: I _have_ verified that you can do a rebuild with a different base image
2015-03-02T15:46:57  <jeblair> mordred: oh!  that could make things much simpler!
2015-03-02T15:46:59  <mordred> yah
2015-03-02T15:46:59  <jeblair> timrc: ^

2015-03-02T15:47:24  <mordred> jeblair: yeah - I think with that, it's really about exposing needs to the reaper
2015-03-02T15:47:29  <timrc> I hate creating VM's so if my resources don't need to change I always go with a rebuild.
2015-03-02T15:48:06  <timrc> jeblair, It should be faster inherently since there's no need to reprovision anything or create / assign floatings ips.

2015-03-02T15:49:36  <mordred> timrc: yah. oy
2015-03-02T15:50:19  <jeblair> timrc: maybe a short program that used shade would be in order.  it could do the steps nodepool currently does, then it could do things again with rebuild.  we can run that on both clouds.
2015-03-02T15:50:56  <mrmartin> hogepodge hi, what you like to integrate with openstackid?
2015-03-02T15:51:22  <hogepodge> mrmartin: We'd like to use it as the identity provider for refstack
2015-03-02T15:51:36  <mordred> jeblair, timrc: ++
2015-03-02T15:51:56  <mrmartin> allright, you have to options, a, integrate an openid auth or, an oauth2
2015-03-02T15:52:02  <clarkb> pashkin the way jenkins is configured it helps to have code review of those jobs and to locate them in a known place so jjb can find them. We need some control of where and what projects can do considering the resources that are handed out. in particular we have nodes for publishing to maven nexus and pypi
2015-03-02T15:52:45  <mordred> timrc: step one- add rebuild support to shade
2015-03-02T15:52:54  <mordred> timrc: should be easy - should be a single function
2015-03-02T15:53:05  <hogepodge> mrmartin: is there one that infra prefers or recommends?
2015-03-02T15:53:07  <mrmartin> hogepodge, first I suggest to do the integration localy, and if you're ready, we can do some tests on live
2015-03-02T15:53:30  <timrc> mordred, Looking at shade now.
2015-03-02T15:53:41  <mrmartin> hogepodge: it depends on you, I'm using oauth2 for groups portal because I can query the profile pictures

2015-03-02T16:50:28  <jeblair> pleia2: cool.  we will need to have each server accept the new ssh host key when we switch
2015-03-02T16:50:30  <clarkb> docs on that should be on the same ci.openstack.org page

Other students do a capstone which is typically a 6 month projects in a small group of 4-5 people. In this case the computer science department has external entities pitch projects to the teams which they then select from and work

2015-03-02T17:47:02  <sdague> yeh, true, the calling interface should be reasonably stable, I'd just imagine the payload might get changed over time to support testing other things the current fake payloads don't cover
2015-03-02T17:47:44  <SpamapS> but right now, for instance, we can't test anything except 'BUILD' status in shade, because the fake has no way to signal "I want an active server".
2015-03-02T17:48:17  <SpamapS> Which means I can't add tests for wait=True, because that does create and then immediately waits for it to turn into ACTIVE

2015-03-02T18:13:49  <mordred> SpamapS: actually, nodepool is being ported to shade - so "shade having functional tests" will be the mechanism whereby nodepool can test its nova interactions
2015-03-02T18:14:28  <mordred> SpamapS: although don't forget that much of the difficulty actually comes around interacting with the other services - glance and neutron and keystone - and figuring out when to use nova and when to use glance/neutron

2015-03-02T18:16:10  <mordred> stevemar: domains and projects and roles and users are all infinitely combinable
2015-03-02T18:16:34  <mordred> stevemar: and in v3, you _must_ pass domain information, as the project list is not automatically filtered by user's current logged in domain
2015-03-02T18:16:48  <mordred> but in v2, there are no domains, so you can't make domain an interface level required parameter
2015-03-02T18:16:54  <stevemar> mordred, bah, the second point should be fixed.
2015-03-02T18:17:15  <mordred> which means that to get sane defaults, I intend to pull the user's current domain from the token
2015-03-02T18:17:28  <mordred> and if the domain is not provided for any domain parameters, provide the one from the current token
2015-03-02T18:18:04  <mordred> this is mainly to facilitate passing project and user by name and not by id
2015-03-02T18:19:25  <stevemar> mordred, this should be interesting once federated users get into the mix

2015-03-02T19:13:33  <clarkb> rcarrillocruz: so I think jenkins must be doing something that affects apt-get/dpkg differently than running it in an interactive shell
2015-03-02T19:13:41  <mordred> clarkb: wow
2015-03-02T19:13:44  <clarkb> and its possible that devstack-gate tickles that
2015-03-02T19:13:56  <clarkb> since we don't seem to see this problem when people just run devstack
2015-03-02T19:14:05  <clarkb> mordred: if you have an insight into that it would be appreciated
2015-03-02T19:14:28  <mordred> clarkb: only thing I can imagine is that it has something to do with how the java process is forking
2015-03-02T19:14:49  <mordred> clarkb: I seem to remember in the fog of my brain that it's one of the reasons we stick a bash -c in front of some things
2015-03-02T19:14:51  <clarkb> mordred: possible, like maybe it is handing off a different stdin or something
2015-03-02T19:14:54  <mordred> yah
2015-03-02T19:15:45  <clarkb> oh also that doesn't seem to be a problem with our images
2015-03-02T19:16:06  <clarkb> so maybe jenkins isn't at fault but something we do during image build? maybe the dist upgrade? its all veryweird
2015-03-02T19:16:25  <mordred> clarkb: I am looking forward to uncomplexity this some more
2015-03-02T19:17:08  <clarkb> so after manually istalling that package set then restarting d-g it does the same thing against a subsequent apt-get install command
2015-03-02T19:17:13  <clarkb> so I don't think a specific package is at fault

2015-03-02T19:38:32  <jogo> mordred jeblair: would that help make things like https://review.openstack.org/#/c/160194/ better
2015-03-02T19:38:48  <jeblair> reed, fifieldt: yeah, i think it is a good idea -- however, i'd want to try to keep it to a minimum (ie, only leave that message once per user or something...); i would not think it would be helpful for, say, mordred's changes to have 50 copies of that message on each :)
2015-03-02T19:38:51  <jogo> aka more obvious that its an issue, make it not an issue etc.
2015-03-02T19:39:06  <jeblair> reed, fifieldt: but i agree the general idea is good, and we can hash details like that out later
2015-03-02T19:40:07  <reed> jeblair, yeah, it's just a matter of optimizing the query or to write the text more about each individual review

2015-03-02T19:41:40  <clarkb> the project specific job configuration is what I was thinking would help
2015-03-02T19:42:41  <clarkb> so rather than apply job data to neutron and nova instead you would sa from neutron and nova's perspective that these jobs should do X and Y

2015-03-02T19:44:15  <clarkb> jogo: fwiw I am not sure it should be confusing, the current behavior is simple and deterministic

2015-03-02T19:44:31  <clarkb> jogo: and its always had this behavior since we first added the functionality

2015-03-02T19:45:10  <pleia2> re: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/148949/ does our mailman stuff actually apply changes like to the admin after a list has been created? (I know people adjust descriptions post creation)
2015-03-02T19:46:00  <jogo> clarkb: the current behavior is non obvious and its easy to miss the subtle interactions
2015-03-02T19:46:12  <jogo> as seen by the fact that no one caught this in my patch
2015-03-02T19:46:14  <clarkb> jogo: how is it non obvious?
2015-03-02T19:46:15  <jogo> the first time
2015-03-02T19:46:39  <clarkb> jogo: I think the larger issue is we are using regexes here and people often don't parse regexes well
2015-03-02T19:47:05  <jogo> clarkb: yes, that and regex and a massive config file means it is easy to literally miss a conflict
2015-03-02T19:47:27  <clarkb> pleia2: I don't think it will apply the update, but is useful should we ever need to redeploy the list server?
2015-03-02T19:48:03  <pleia2> clarkb: fair enough, I'll +A and make a comment accordingly
2015-03-02T19:48:56  <pleia2> ah, looking at the live list it looks like they did go in to mailman and update their address already
2015-03-02T19:49:08  <AJaeger_> jogo: is https://review.openstack.org/#/c/160194/ urgent to get in? How broken is the situation?

2015-03-02T19:49:34  <jogo> AJaeger_: not very AFAIK, it only impacts neutron
2015-03-02T19:49:38  <jogo> and means extra jobs run
2015-03-02T19:49:41  <jogo> not fewer
2015-03-02T19:49:52  <clarkb> jogo: is the last match wins behavior not what you would expect? I guess that is my real question
2015-03-02T19:50:09  <jeblair> jogo: let's make sure marun is involved in reviews on skip-if changes
2015-03-02T19:50:16  <clarkb> last match wins is what I prefer to see as its unambiguous vs merging things and which side has priority and so on
2015-03-02T19:50:31  <jogo> clarkb: no, its not. because of the 'project' part of skip-if
2015-03-02T19:50:35  <jogo> jeblair: yes please, good point
2015-03-02T19:50:40  <clarkb> jogo: not sure I follow
2015-03-02T19:50:48  <clarkb> jogo: you want something other than last match wins?
2015-03-02T19:50:50  <jogo> jeblair AJaeger_: plus this impacts code marun wrote
2015-03-02T19:51:12  <clarkb> what would you suggest as a better alternative to last match wins?
2015-03-02T19:51:15  <marun> jogo: hmmm, so the nova regex was too broad
2015-03-02T19:51:36  <clarkb> jogo: I don't think we want to merge things becuse then you get ambiguity in a less easy to understand way
2015-03-02T19:51:41  <marun> jogo: I think it would be preferable to exclude the neutron jobs from nova rather than merging them

2015-03-02T19:51:49  <clarkb> marun: why is that?

2015-03-02T19:52:09  <marun> jogo: Really?
2015-03-02T19:52:09  <clarkb> doing so makes the regex more complicated and I think the regexes are where we acutally have the problem
2015-03-02T19:52:12  <clarkb> jogo: you can
2015-03-02T19:52:16  <marun> jogo: (!?neutron)
2015-03-02T19:52:20  <jogo> marun: job names are the same
2015-03-02T19:52:24  <jogo> nova runs those tests too
2015-03-02T19:52:25  <marun> jogo: they are not the same
2015-03-02T19:52:35  <marun> jogo: hmmm
2015-03-02T19:52:47  <clarkb> either way the current set for neutron and nova has to stay
2015-03-02T19:52:53  <jogo> check-tempest-dsvm-neutron-full  gate-tempest-dsvm-neutron-large-ops
2015-03-02T19:52:53  <clarkb> you can have a second set for non neutron jobs though
2015-03-02T19:53:35  <jogo> clarkb: I assumed the 'project: ^openstack/neutron$' line prevented conflicts like this
2015-03-02T19:53:36  <marun> jogo: ah, I see
2015-03-02T19:53:49  <clarkb> jogo: its not a conflict
2015-03-02T19:53:50  <marun> jogo: the skip-if application is done without regard to the target projects
2015-03-02T19:54:00  <clarkb> jogo: its specifically the lack of any conflicts via last match wins
2015-03-02T19:54:10  <jogo> marun: well I know that know
2015-03-02T19:54:12  <marun> jogo: so that the matcher for one project can't co-exist with another for the same job
2015-03-02T19:54:22  <clarkb> if however you switch to merging things that would require conflict resolution
2015-03-02T19:55:07  <marun> clarkb: might it be preferable to allow merging skip-if clauses across metajobs?
2015-03-02T19:55:17  <clarkb> marun: imo no, because we have never merged any of that job data
2015-03-02T19:55:23  <marun> clarkb: it should be possible to detect conflicts as errors and prevent them from merging

2015-03-02T19:59:22  <clarkb> marun: last match wins is part of that, if I read through the list I know exactly what behavior I will get at the end
2015-03-02T19:59:34  <marun> clarkb: yeah, I got that *you* understand the configuration.

2015-03-02T19:59:48  <marun> clarkb: I'm not sure why you're not willing to admin that it's complicated for folks that don't live and breath it.'
2015-03-02T19:59:54  <marun> admin -> admit
2015-03-02T20:00:06  <clarkb> I do admit that portions of it are complicated but not the last match wins behavior
2015-03-02T20:00:08  <marun> clarkb: and that's today...  this is going to keep evolving.
2015-03-02T20:00:09  <clarkb> because thats simple
2015-03-02T20:00:23  <marun> clarkb: simple to implement, I get.
2015-03-02T20:00:33  <mordred> clarkb: I think I'd say that, if we have people coming and saying that as new users it's complicated for them, it's worthwhile to hear that - I mean, I'm sure that keystone domains make sense to the keystone team
2015-03-02T20:00:33  <clarkb> IMO the complicatedness is part of using regexes as the keys for elements in the tree
2015-03-02T20:00:37  <marun> clarkb: simple to reason about? Not sure I can agree.

2015-03-02T20:01:01  <mordred> stevemar: :)
2015-03-02T20:01:04  <AJaeger_> clarkb: the problem for me is that it's not always obvious that a regex matches multiple things *by accident*
2015-03-02T20:01:10  <clarkb> AJaeger_: yes exactly
2015-03-02T20:01:15  <marun> clarkb: I'm suggesting that we add checks for conflicting skip-if matchers.
2015-03-02T20:01:29  <clarkb> marun: you were suggesting we merge skip ifs
2015-03-02T20:01:33  <marun> clarkb: they could run on merges
2015-03-02T20:01:34  <clarkb> marun: which is a break in behavior
2015-03-02T20:01:36  *** saper has quit IRC
2015-03-02T20:01:36  *** saper has joined #openstack-infra
2015-03-02T20:01:47  <greghaynes> clearly we should make on giant CFG out of all the regexes in our config
2015-03-02T20:02:04  <marun> clarkb: so we have 2 choices...
2015-03-02T20:02:27  <marun> clarkb: I'm hearing that manually merging is the preferred path?
2015-03-02T20:02:46  *** otter768 has joined #openstack-infra
2015-03-02T20:02:55  <clarkb> marun: imo yes because it avoids surpises and maintains consistent behavior with the rest of the config
2015-03-02T20:03:36  <marun> clarkb: That's fine. And does that path imply that we don't want errors or warnings when multiple skip-if clauses are found to match?
2015-03-02T20:03:49  <clarkb> no
2015-03-02T20:03:57  <marun> clarkb: ok.
2015-03-02T20:04:20  <marun> clarkb: So I'm happy with jogo

2015-03-02T20:06:42  <clarkb> marun: sure, I would say that we should general warn/error on any overwrites though if that is the approach. To be consistent
2015-03-02T20:06:56  <marun> clarkb: understood.

2015-03-02T20:32:41  <mtreinish> mrmartin: the only issue is the storage location, the upgrade command runs on logstash.o.o and I don't think we want a many gb sql dump on that node

2015-03-02T20:36:14  <mtreinish> I ran a mysqldump locally at home over the weekend and it was ~20gb
2015-03-02T20:36:21  <clarkb> mtreinish: you could have it be in /opt somewhere on the server which is where we mount the ephemeral drive
2015-03-02T20:36:23  <mrmartin> this bup we are using for backup does deduplication in some form
2015-03-02T20:36:31  <clarkb> mtreinish: then just keep a single backup file
2015-03-02T20:37:03  <clarkb> except on logstash.o.o we haven't mounted tha drive

2015-03-02T21:46:08  <jeblair> this idea might be untenable, but i'd like to limp along until after mordred's attempt to remove the puppetmaster is complete before we make any decisions; i think things are still too much in flux to invest too much in this right now.

2015-03-02T23:33:04  <mtreinish> jogo: well that could just be because your system didn't have the proper permissions on /opt, the nodepool script might create things correctly first

2015-03-02T23:34:32  <clarkb> mtreinish: jogo since each image is distrp release specific the wheels will be built for it just fine
2015-03-02T23:34:36  <jogo> clarkb: I think
2015-03-02T23:35:14  <mtreinish> clarkb: I mean I can create the wheels and move them wherever too I jsut figured it was easier to call the devstack script
2015-03-02T23:35:16  <tchaypo> jeblair: one sec

2015-03-02T23:37:51  <mtreinish> clarkb: sure, the optimization we're looking for here is to stop compiling wheels during the jobs. Compared to the 10+ min hit we take for that everything will be better
2015-03-02T23:38:30  <clarkb> mtreinish: jogo maybe we should back up a second, in theory all of those wheelhouse items are being built regardless

2015-03-02T23:39:28  <jogo> of /opt/stack/new/.wheelhouse
2015-03-02T23:39:39  <clarkb> jogo: no
2015-03-02T23:39:53  <clarkb> jogo: it would get copied to /opt/stack/.wheelhouse on the newly mounted filesystem under /opt

2015-03-02T23:40:04  <jogo> so something else may be wrong
2015-03-02T23:40:18  <mtreinish> clarkb: it's probably how devstack is checking and using the wheels
2015-03-02T23:40:19  <jogo> but this is a good win even if this isn't the regression itself
2015-03-02T23:40:25  <clarkb> jogo: or its possible that we don't use the wheelhouse so we don't save any time
2015-03-02T23:40:29  <mtreinish> clarkb: because it's calling tools/build_wheels.sh on every run

2015-03-02T23:40:42  <jogo> clarkb: I think we are using wheelhouse based on the logs

2015-03-02T23:43:50  <greghaynes> There were several. The first one was an issue with fallback behavior when a wheel was not found in a directory index (which was a result of another bug where case insensitivity didnt work for local dir indexes)

2015-03-02T23:44:49  <dstufft> yea
2015-03-02T23:45:07  <clarkb> for the second thats not really a problem, we are trying to reduce compile times not avoid easy installs

2015-03-02T23:45:40  <greghaynes> yes, but the problem is that it would search the wheelhouse and then bail and not fall back when it couldnt install anything
2015-03-02T23:45:45  <tchaypo> I worked around  the file-not-found upstream

2015-03-02T23:48:53  <jogo> clarkb: and no, we should still cache pip packages locally if possible anyway
2015-03-02T23:49:00  <greghaynes> clarkb: acually, we used index-url, looks like stackrc uses find-links?
2015-03-02T23:49:05  <dstufft> it's not currently possibly with bandersnatch, though there's a devpi thing
2015-03-02T23:49:07  <greghaynes> no idea what the difference is there

2015-03-02T23:50:21  <jogo> dtroyer: but you got the list wrong search for gcc on http://logs.openstack.org/94/160494/1/check/check-tempest-dsvm-full/85e0294//logs/devstacklog.txt.gz#_2015-03-02_21_59_00_996
2015-03-02T23:51:09  <jogo> clarkb: how much bigger would the image be ?
2015-03-02T23:51:13  <dtroyer> what is wrong?  I don't try to get them all, just the known problem children
2015-03-02T23:51:15  *** erlon has quit IRC
2015-03-02T23:51:21  <jogo> also we could use devpi-server and do stuff in the background or something
2015-03-02T23:51:37  <jogo> dtroyer: problem is devstack is taking 20 minutes to launch now
2015-03-02T23:51:51  <jogo> dtroyer: and not 100% clear what the issue is

2015-03-02T23:51:55  <mordred> jogo: dont add devpi-server
2015-03-02T23:52:03  <clarkb> jogo: the entire mirror is 130GB, I would have to go rebuild a wheel only mirror with pypi-mirror to see what our subset of the world is
2015-03-02T23:52:07  <clarkb> probably at least a gig
2015-03-02T23:52:18  <jogo> dtroyer: 21:56:53 -> 22:14:43
2015-03-02T23:52:25  * jogo gets coffee
2015-03-02T23:52:26  <clarkb> though we can avoid building wheels for all the platforms if we do it per image so maybe not that bad
2015-03-02T23:52:31  <dtroyer> jogo: you specifically said I had the list wrong…what about the list is wrong?

2015-03-02T23:56:24  <Sukhdev> I set up the networking_arista project for our ML2 driver decomposition - I got all the infra pieces in place except for the lauchpad
