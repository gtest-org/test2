2015-05-10T00:02:02  <clarkb> foobio: did you have any trouble with `git review` and pushing those changes up earlier? It is either very slow or hanging for me
2015-05-10T00:02:13  <openstackgerrit> Clark Boylan proposed openstack-infra/zuul: Simplify cloner required parameters  https://review.openstack.org/181694
2015-05-10T00:02:18  *** sputnik13 has joined #openstack-infra
2015-05-10T00:02:20  <clarkb> finally it goes through

2015-05-10T00:02:47  <clarkb> jeblair: I think ^ or something like it is a feature we should support for zuul-cloner.
2015-05-10T00:03:15  <clarkb> mordred: nibalizer: in particular I think 181694 enables zuul-cloner a bit more for beaker use so that beaker can run on a dev's laptop or in the gate and be happy either way
2015-05-10T00:03:34  <clarkb> ok back to weekend

2015-05-10T16:53:33  <mordred> clarkb: which is that we cache all the source repositories, but our install_modules.sh script is unaware of this, so it clones from the internet
2015-05-10T16:53:49  <mordred> clarkb: when it _Could_ be cloning most of our puppet modules from /opt/git
2015-05-10T16:54:07  <mordred> it's not a huge deal, obviously
2015-05-10T16:54:36  <nibalizer> mordred: right but thats a cache that can be hours out of date right?
2015-05-10T16:54:43  <nibalizer> it could clone from /opt/git then git fetch i guess
2015-05-10T16:54:49  <mordred> not in the contect of an image build
2015-05-10T16:54:57  <nibalizer> or pull, rather
2015-05-10T16:55:04  <mordred> when it builds the image, it clones the repos to be part of the cache, then it installs puppet
2015-05-10T16:55:16  <mordred> so it literlaly just then did a clone of all of the repos from the internet
2015-05-10T16:55:49  <clarkb> mordred see my zuul-cloner patch from yesterday :)

2015-05-10T16:59:09  <clarkb> mordred basically aims to make zuul cloner useful in the context of a git cache but without zuul parameters

2015-05-10T16:59:18  <mordred> I am in favor of such a thing
2015-05-10T16:59:35  <clarkb> mordred yes, but we already install it on all nodes so should be fine, just moving where we do it

2015-05-10T17:07:20  <mordred> clarkb: you know, we could make zuul-env slimmer if all it wants to do is use zuul-cloner - cloner only depends on extras and GitPython
2015-05-10T17:07:54  <mordred> clarkb: of course, also not super important to do this instant - but if we make zuul-env part of install_puppet, we may want to consider that
2015-05-10T17:08:21  <clarkb> ya I think splitting zuul-cloner out of the zuul deps tree would be good

2015-05-10T17:16:07  <hogepodge> How is the gerrit fork managed? I see lots of openstack forks.
2015-05-10T17:16:51  <greghaynes> mordred: haha, I think we have a counter somewhere for every time someone tries to 'fix' ssh hostkey generation
2015-05-10T17:16:59  <mordred> hogepodge: we're running http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/gerrit/log/?h=openstack/2.10.2
2015-05-10T17:17:08  <mordred> greghaynes: :)
2015-05-10T17:17:22  <mordred> greghaynes: well, if ubuntu would notice when they're not missing on boot, it would be nifty
2015-05-10T17:17:32  <hogepodge> mordred: so are patches submitted against that?
2015-05-10T17:17:40  <hogepodge> mordred: or master?
2015-05-10T17:18:08  <clarkb> neither, they go upstream
2015-05-10T17:18:17  <clarkb> we dont run a proper fork anymore
2015-05-10T17:19:09  <mordred> we do backport a few things in from time to time
2015-05-10T17:19:27  <mordred> also - we're going to have to figure out the '2.11 removes old change screen' thing
2015-05-10T17:19:33  <mordred> hogepodge: what's the thing you're wanting to fix?
2015-05-10T17:20:17  <hogepodge> mordred: I want to add a link to the "Download" part of the UI that offers 'git review -d CHANGE_ID' as an option.
2015-05-10T17:20:17  <clarkb> ya we currate backported patches but thats it
2015-05-10T17:20:38  <zaro> hogepodge, mordred : i believe that's done in the download plugin: https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/download-commands/
2015-05-10T17:20:49  <mordred> aha!
2015-05-10T17:21:31  <clarkb> mordred I want zuul cloner to be easy to use without special install steps, but that may be a good intermediate step
2015-05-10T17:21:37  <mordred> I think that would be an excellent addition to the download plugin
2015-05-10T17:21:39  <mordred> clarkb: ++
2015-05-10T17:21:52  <mordred> yeah - it may take us a little while to get it all split and whatnot
2015-05-10T17:22:07  <mordred> hogepodge: https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/download-commands/+/master/src/main/java/com/googlesource/gerrit/plugins/download/command/RepoCommand.java
2015-05-10T17:22:22  <mordred> hogepodge: looking at the repo command entry, adding a git review entry seems pretty simple
2015-05-10T17:22:36  *** sergsh has quit IRC
2015-05-10T17:23:49  <clarkb> maybe it should be configurable?
2015-05-10T17:24:01  <clarkb> anyways back to weekend
2015-05-10T17:24:14  <mordred> it is - you can configure which schemes are used
2015-05-10T17:24:22  <zaro> hogepodge, mordred : doc for it is in the resources folder.  probably would be good to make it optional. https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/download-commands/+/master/src/main/resources/Documentation
2015-05-10T17:25:25  <hogepodge> zaro: is git review our own special sauce? I thought go was providing their own with the same name. Would a patch for it be accepted upstream?
2015-05-10T17:26:12  <clarkb> patch unlikely to get accepted if hard coded, thats why I suggest a configurable list
2015-05-10T17:26:13  <zaro> hogepodge: yes, git review is an openstack-infra project
2015-05-10T17:26:46  *** stevemar has joined #openstack-infra
2015-05-10T17:26:58  <mordred> hogepodge: yeah - go decided to write their own thing
2015-05-10T17:27:08  <mordred> hogepodge: even though ours was already there and usable
2015-05-10T17:27:12  <mordred> hogepodge: beacuse *bonghits*
2015-05-10T17:27:29  <mordred> but whatev
2015-05-10T17:27:32  <zaro> i would probably create a seperate plugin for git review options download options.
2015-05-10T17:27:47  <clarkb> zaro why? just add a gerrit.config list
2015-05-10T17:27:59  <mordred> clarkb: the arguments provided to the command are different
2015-05-10T17:28:08  <mordred> so just giving a list of commands isn't going to be good enough, no?
2015-05-10T17:28:10  <clarkb> mordred no they are a subset
2015-05-10T17:28:18  <mordred> aroo?
2015-05-10T17:28:29  <zaro> because i think that might not get accepted
2015-05-10T17:28:35  <zaro> upstream
2015-05-10T17:28:36  <clarkb> fetch takes full ref, git review just change number
2015-05-10T17:28:45  <mordred> right
2015-05-10T17:28:48  <clarkb> full ref includes change number
2015-05-10T17:29:31  *** otter768 has joined #openstack-infra
2015-05-10T17:29:35  <clarkb> zaro even if its a configurable listing?
2015-05-10T17:29:45  <mordred> so - are you saying "make enabling of the download scheme configurable"? because that I agree with
2015-05-10T17:29:53  <clarkb> yes
2015-05-10T17:30:18  <mordred> ok. I thought you were saying "make a thing so that you could define an arbitrary download command in config" :)
2015-05-10T17:30:38  <clarkb> `git fetch $ref && git checkout FETCH_HEAD`
2015-05-10T17:30:42  <clarkb> yes thats how you do iy
2015-05-10T17:30:57  <zaro> clarkb: ohh you might be right.  i guess i would try upstreaming to download commands plugin first.
2015-05-10T17:30:59  <clarkb> the `git review $change_number` in a list
2015-05-10T17:31:19  *** freerunner has joined #openstack-infra
2015-05-10T17:32:04  <zaro> i think it's just a tough sell because it's git review specific so i might consider that related but outside the scope of the download command
2015-05-10T17:32:10  *** teran has joined #openstack-infra
2015-05-10T17:32:12  <clarkb> no thats my point
2015-05-10T17:32:18  <clarkb> dont make it specific to any command
2015-05-10T17:32:29  <hogepodge> zaro: yeah, that would be my concern.
2015-05-10T17:32:35  <mordred> clarkb: you'd have to completely rewrite the entire plugin
2015-05-10T17:32:48  <mordred> when adding git-review as an optional scheme would take 5 minutes
2015-05-10T17:32:53  <hogepodge> java patterns ftw
2015-05-10T17:33:07  <clarkb> mordred gotcha
2015-05-10T17:33:15  <clarkb> but upstream wont take it
2015-05-10T17:33:24  <mordred> why not?
2015-05-10T17:33:28  *** sputnik13 has joined #openstack-infra
2015-05-10T17:33:37  <zaro> mordred: no, the git-review plugin can build on top of the download command
2015-05-10T17:33:42  *** sdake has joined #openstack-infra
2015-05-10T17:33:47  <zaro> just make it a dependency.
2015-05-10T17:33:49  <mordred> git-review is more widely used than repo is - why not have a config option to expose it?
2015-05-10T17:33:55  <clarkb> mordred because they have never wanted anything to do with our tools
2015-05-10T17:34:09  <zaro> that's how the its plugins work.  there's an its-base and the its-bugzilla, its-jira, etc..
2015-05-10T17:34:28  <mordred> well, whichever is fine by me honestly
2015-05-10T17:34:57  <mordred> I find it a very sad thought that they would not accept a patch to the plugin to enable what is probably the #1 tool used to download gerrit changes
2015-05-10T17:35:12  <mordred> but, you know, if that's how it is, then we can do what zaro says
2015-05-10T17:35:23  <zaro> i might be completely wrong about this though.
2015-05-10T17:35:31  <clarkb> adding a second plugin seems silly fwiw
2015-05-10T17:36:06  <clarkb> but that may just be reality of gerrits design
2015-05-10T17:36:14  *** freerunner has quit IRC
2015-05-10T17:36:31  <mordred> it all seems silly. I'd try a patch to the plugin first and let them reject it - becuase it's like  12 line patch and rejecting it would be kinda crazy
2015-05-10T17:36:33  *** stevemar has quit IRC

2015-05-10T17:37:53  <sdake> I fear the answer is no, but is it possible to delete a  tag in openstack git namespace?
2015-05-10T17:38:03  <sdake> magnum 2015.1.0 is DOA as is and needs 3 backports
2015-05-10T17:38:25  <mordred> sdake: physically possible, but a terrible idea. the tag is what it is
2015-05-10T17:38:39  <mordred> sdake: solution is to make an additional tag
2015-05-10T17:38:56  <sdake> what tag would you recommend
2015-05-10T17:39:00  <sdake> 2015.1.0.0?
2015-05-10T17:39:04  *** yfried_ has joined #openstack-infra
2015-05-10T17:39:06  <mordred> sdake: so, if 2015.1.0 is bad, merge the backports into the stable branch and cut a 2015.1.1
2015-05-10T17:39:20  <sdake> isn't 2015.1.1 on a standard release process?
2015-05-10T17:39:51  <mordred> probably, in any case, you should probably chat with ttx about when he's in on Monday
2015-05-10T17:39:59  <sdake> thanks will do
2015-05-10T17:40:17  <mordred> cool! general idea is that once a tag is cut it's permanent
2015-05-10T17:41:02  <greghaynes> mordred: did you cut a os-c-c release?
2015-05-10T17:41:07  <mordred> greghaynes: I did
2015-05-10T17:41:14  <greghaynes> \O/

2015-05-10T17:41:35  <mordred> that clarify env/file/arg precedence
2015-05-10T17:42:29  <greghaynes> mordred: should we bump the os-c-c req for shade then?
2015-05-10T17:42:51  <mordred> greghaynes: I think I've got a patch up to do so, yeah

2015-05-10T17:44:00  <greghaynes> mordred: does that delete it? or do we want to also rm it before dpkg-reconfigure?

2015-05-10T17:44:26  <greghaynes> ah, ok

2015-05-10T17:44:35  <greghaynes> oh wow
2015-05-10T17:44:40  <sdake> mordred think you could +a a review Andreas already had a look at for project-config?
2015-05-10T17:44:41  <greghaynes> is that not just an ubuntu bug?

2015-05-10T18:39:02  <mordred> and it LOOKS like the API wants the properties parameter in v2 to be a string- which means I think I need to json encode the properties dict before passing it as an argument

2015-05-10T21:40:40  <ianw> something happens inbetween to redirect... to /#
2015-05-10T21:41:32  <foobio> i'm guessing something has happened with the link matching engine in 2.10... zaro ^?
2015-05-10T21:42:25  <foobio> the extra / seems to be what's causing the problem
2015-05-10T21:42:28  <nibalizer> it only does it on some of them
2015-05-10T21:42:31  <nibalizer> https://review.openstack.org/#/c/178760/ works for instance
2015-05-10T21:42:49  <ianw> yeah, and actually i reloaded and don't see it, i think ... weird
2015-05-10T21:42:51  <nibalizer> foobio is right though

2015-05-10T21:43:45  <foobio> any idea if it's those with change-id starting I[:alpha:] vs I[:digit]?
2015-05-10T21:43:46  <lifeless> clarkb: I give you https://twitter.com/rbtcollins/status/597517090992455680
2015-05-10T21:44:05  <ianw> ahh, yeah, that first // in the review.openstack.org ... what link did i follow to get to that?
2015-05-10T21:44:35  <foobio> the link substitution seems to add an additional / on some of those relative links
2015-05-10T21:45:24  <ianw> i think that this started right after i logged in, i got redirected back to https://review.openstack.org//
2015-05-10T21:46:09  <foobio> maybe it's something afoul with the openid config
2015-05-10T21:46:28  <ianw> yep, that's it, when i logged out and back in, i end up at the // version
2015-05-10T21:47:04  <ianw> that persists until you hit a link that makes gerrit barf
2015-05-10T21:48:52  <stevebaker> Is there a fix in sight for the pypy jobs, or should we make them non-voting?

2015-05-10T21:52:49  <ianw> also a lot of 404's for https://review.openstack.org/accounts/self/avatar?s=26 in firebug
2015-05-10T21:53:34  <clarkb> thats normal, we dont have avatars
2015-05-10T21:54:00  <clarkb> (was an issue on 2.8 as well)
2015-05-10T21:54:24  <clarkb> stevebaker I pushed a fix but it needs review
2015-05-10T21:54:38  <clarkb> (update virtualenv to latest version)

2015-05-10T21:59:09  <lifeless> ahhhh
2015-05-10T21:59:11  <lifeless> figured it out
2015-05-10T21:59:18  <lifeless> the embedded copy installs the .so
2015-05-10T21:59:20  <lifeless> not the .h
2015-05-10T21:59:24  <lifeless> so if you pip install it
2015-05-10T21:59:27  <lifeless> then pip uninstal it
2015-05-10T21:59:35  <lifeless> then pip install it, it will fall over in a heap
2015-05-10T22:02:03  <lifeless> erm, does install the .h
2015-05-10T22:02:09  <lifeless> doesn't serch for it effectively
2015-05-10T22:03:30  <foobio> clarkb: i'm cool with the virtualenv update patch, just didn't want to approve it right before gerrit upgrade madness, nor over the weekend when nobody's around to revert should it cause yet more and new exciting problems
2015-05-10T22:03:51  <lifeless> weekend? What weekend.
2015-05-10T22:03:53  <lifeless> Tis MONDAY
