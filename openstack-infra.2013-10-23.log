2013-10-23T00:00:49  <superbee> fwiw the reason I didn't go down the hadoop path had to do with needing programmers, and how access would work, and I hear hadoop doesn't do so well on VMs but you probably know better
2013-10-23T00:01:26  <superbee> (I wanted indexed logs that gave developers and API, not something that required building an API that could potentially be used to send spam or whatever)
2013-10-23T00:01:38  <SergeyLukjanov> superbee, in some tests it works better on VMs due to the FS caching, RAM utilization and etc.
2013-10-23T00:02:27  <superbee> in any case I am curious to see what you come up with.
2013-10-23T00:02:36  <SergeyLukjanov> superbee, I'm agreed with ElasticSearch+Logstash+Kibana for such problem
2013-10-23T00:02:59  <superbee> cool, I wasn't completely crazy then :)

2013-10-23T00:03:31  <SergeyLukjanov> Hadoop is for the bulk workloads, for example, you can build search index using it each day
2013-10-23T00:04:00  <SergeyLukjanov> I mean run huge job each day to process data for the prev. day
2013-10-23T00:04:01  <superbee> Ryan_Lane: how is it looking?
2013-10-23T00:04:05  <superbee> SergeyLukjanov: ah
2013-10-23T00:04:11  <superbee> SergeyLukjanov: rather than do it incrementally
2013-10-23T00:04:13  <superbee> that makes sense
2013-10-23T00:04:13  <Ryan_Lane> one sec

2013-10-23T00:04:32  <SergeyLukjanov> superbee, yeah, it's more offline tool than realtime
2013-10-23T00:05:11  <SergeyLukjanov> for realtime stable and reliable processing Hadoop+Storm could be used but it's the really rocket sciency to make such system work good :)

2013-10-23T00:10:52  <Ryan_Lane> has nothing to do with ES itself
2013-10-23T00:11:23  <superbee> Ryan_Lane: so you don't need me to help debug ES?
2013-10-23T00:11:34  <Ryan_Lane> nope
2013-10-23T00:11:41  <superbee> cool. I am going to head home then
2013-10-23T00:11:57  <Ryan_Lane> thanks
2013-10-23T00:13:01  <Ryan_Lane> actually, I think I have it working. didn't follow the instructions properly before

2013-10-23T00:15:12  <Ryan_Lane> cool. ES is working for mediawiki now, so we'll finally have a less-shitty search

2013-10-23T09:23:33  <jbooboo> ttx: the nov 6 17:30 slot assigned to infra conflicts with the meet the tc conf session.  we have _at least_ 4 tc members interested in infra topics...
2013-10-23T09:23:57  <jbooboo> ttx: any way we can trade slots with a program with less tc-member interest?

2013-10-23T09:26:47  <amotoki> hi, I notice most bug number in commit messages are not linked to LP bug. It seems only "bug: 1234567" format is linked. Is there any change?
2013-10-23T09:27:07  <ttx> jbooboo: it's a bit tricky, could swap with QA but then Trove would miss a lot of QA content.
2013-10-23T09:27:31  <ttx> jbooboo: is there a session in infra you could schedule there that would not appeal that much to those tc/infra members ?
2013-10-23T09:28:13  <ttx> jbooboo: otherwise I guess we could stripe QA/Infra on that afternoon

2013-10-23T09:31:15  <jbooboo> ttx: i'll look at the schedule, but i think it's unlikely that i would want to schedule a session that neither monty nor i want to attend.
2013-10-23T09:34:06  <jbooboo> i'm tempted to schedule 'preemtively integrate the universe' in that slot and just move the tc panel into the infra design session.  :)

2013-10-23T09:58:51  <ttx> jbooboo: i'm fine with swapping the last slot between infra and QA if you can get sdague to agree to it
2013-10-23T09:58:58  <ttx> just let me know
2013-10-23T10:00:06  <jbooboo> ttx: ok.  i know sdague has the same concerns, but let's ask anyway:

2013-10-23T10:42:55  <sdague> my default is matplotlib for stuff like that
2013-10-23T10:43:32  <ttx> sdague: probably better than using nvd3.org "live preview" and screenshots

2013-10-23T11:16:43  <sdague> my intent is to spin it off, but I want to evolve it in tree for a bit to ensure it's useful
2013-10-23T11:16:45  <hashar> sdague: make sense.  Might end up writing an official bash style standard :D

2013-10-23T11:18:41  <hashar> I guess it just execute statements one after the other and does not actually parse the source file
2013-10-23T11:18:47  <sdague> hashar: no, you'd have to build your own parser for that
2013-10-23T11:18:53  <sdague> yeh, exactly

2013-10-23T14:36:58  <sileht> dhellmann, I'm not sure but I don't think other projects needs to do a lot of concurrent operation on the db backend
2013-10-23T14:38:08  <sileht> dhellmann, this problem seems only occur when the ceilometer collector take too much to write samples in db

2013-10-23T14:56:52  <sdague> dhellmann: that I don't know, but is there a reason it can't be set for ceilometer?
2013-10-23T14:57:09  <dhellmann> sdague: because the option controlling the default is in oslo, not ceilometer, right?
2013-10-23T14:57:30  <sdague> different apps clearly have different access patterns for the db, so it doesn't make sense to have that not settable at the app level
2013-10-23T14:57:50  <dhellmann> sdague: that makes sense, I'm just saying that's how the code works now :-)
2013-10-23T14:57:54  <sdague> dhellmann: sure :)
2013-10-23T14:58:00  <sdague> but that's kinda crazy :)
2013-10-23T14:58:01  <dhellmann> the way it is controlled at the app level is the config file, no?
2013-10-23T14:58:06  <sileht> dhellmann, sdague the low defaults permit to identify sqlalchemy threading problem (or pseudo-threading problem)
2013-10-23T14:58:52  <sdague> dhellmann: right, but having it have to be overridden for every real deployment seems ... sub-optimal. I'd really like to see sane by default defaults

Do the sched.org folks have suggestions for separation?
2013-10-23T15:01:26  <dhellmann> sdague: so we need to move the option definition out of oslo's db code somehow? or have ceilometer override the default for those options before reading the config file, I guess.

2013-10-23T15:02:52  *** wenlock_ has quit IRC
2013-10-23T15:02:54  <markmc> sdague, pattern for per-app defaults of config options in oslo code is to add a set_defaults() method
2013-10-23T15:03:12  <dhellmann> markmc: how well does that work if the option isn't defined?
2013-10-23T15:03:13  <sdague> markmc: ok, cool, so we already have that ability?
2013-10-23T15:03:28  <markmc> dhellmann, huh?
2013-10-23T15:03:31  <dhellmann> markmc: because this option will only be defined if the sql driver is being used
2013-10-23T15:03:50  <dhellmann> so ceilometer might try to set the default for the sqlalchemy pool size when mongo is being used, for example
2013-10-23T15:03:59  <dhellmann> which shouldn't fail, but also doesn't make a lot of sense
2013-10-23T15:04:07  <markmc> dhellmann, well, we already have openstack.common.db.sqlalchemy.session.set_defaults()
2013-10-23T15:04:23  <markmc> dhellmann, no big deal to call that even if the driver isn't being used
2013-10-23T15:04:31  <dhellmann> markmc: ok, I guess if we import that to call it the options will be defined
2013-10-23T15:04:36  <markmc> dhellmann, apart from it requiring sqlalchemy be installed
2013-10-23T15:04:40  <dhellmann> yeah
2013-10-23T15:05:15  <dhellmann> ceilometer can handle the import failure
2013-10-23T15:06:38  <sileht> dhellmann, if the sqlalchemy backend fail to init stevedore already handle that, no ?
2013-10-23T15:06:59  <dhellmann> sileht: ok, I didn't know we did that
2013-10-23T15:07:10  <dhellmann> oh, no, hang on
2013-10-23T15:07:11  <dhellmann> misread that
2013-10-23T15:07:50  <dhellmann> markmc: does it matter whether set_defaults() is called after the config file is read?
2013-10-23T15:08:16  <sdague> foobio: fixed that regex review again, think it's good to go now
2013-10-23T15:08:20  <dhellmann> sileht: I was assuming we had to call set_defaults() before reading the config file, so the config settings could override those defaults
2013-10-23T15:08:20  <markmc> dhellmann, just needs to be called before the option is referenced
2013-10-23T15:08:27  <dhellmann> markmc: ah, ok

2013-10-23T15:17:37  <anteaya> well this is what I understand you are after so far: foobio, can you help me out with creating some more OpenStack resources for Fuel? I would like to register a channel and ask about a couple more things
2013-10-23T15:17:48  <anteaya> so registering a channel
2013-10-23T15:17:55  <anteaya> create the channel and become ops
2013-10-23T15:17:56  <mattymo> I would like to register #openstack-fuel as a channel with gerrit notifications to our stackforge Gerrit repositories, related jenkins jobs, and enabling logging for this channel

2013-10-23T15:20:55  <foobio> i'm unsure, honestly, whether infra registers channels which are not being used officially as a project resource (fuel's still on stackforge right?)

2013-10-23T15:43:28  <dachary> Hi, I would like to implement third party integration tests ( as explained in http://ci.openstack.org/third_party.html ) for the benefit of the new puppet-ceph module. I thought about using an openstack tenant to do so ( as described in https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Puppet-openstack/ceph-blueprint#Integration_tests ). I'm curious to know if small scale projects implemented something similar ( I know large scale projects have that but
2013-10-23T15:43:29  <dachary> it's probably too much for just one puppet module ;-)

2013-10-23T15:45:53  <foobio> dachary: it might be worthwhile to see what bodepd_ and mgagne think as well
2013-10-23T15:45:54  <anteaya> he is the creator of the smoketest suite
2013-10-23T15:46:28  <foobio> er, i am confusing mgagne with someone else just now i think
2013-10-23T15:46:35  <mgagne> foobio: hi
2013-10-23T15:46:36  <dachary> foobio: bodepd_ like the idea, mgagne does not seem to oppose and did not propose an alternate solution.

2013-10-23T15:47:08  <dachary> foobio: I think mgagne is aware of https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Puppet-openstack/ceph-blueprint#Integration_tests so you're not that confused ;-)
2013-10-23T15:47:11  <foobio> mgagne: do you work on the openstack-puppet project umbrella?
2013-10-23T15:47:28  <foobio> ahh, great. i wasn't confusing him with someone else. even better ;)
2013-10-23T15:47:30  <mgagne> foobio: yes with bodepd_
2013-10-23T15:47:50  <mgagne> dachary, foobio: I don't have an opinion as I don't know the extend of support we can get from openstack-infra regarding the infra itself.
2013-10-23T15:48:36  <dachary> mgagne: I think foobio was suggesting more an opinion on how to go about integration testing
2013-10-23T15:48:36  <foobio> i just wasn't sure to what extent the test infrastructure you had been hashing out for the other puppet modules might or might not already be similar
2013-10-23T15:48:44  <hub_cap> hey is gating on py33 as simple as adding py33 in the tox.ini envlist?
2013-10-23T15:49:30  <mgagne> foobio: we use jenkins slaves to run rspec tests (unit tests) only, not integration tests where we would spawn services and such. this would require root access.
2013-10-23T15:49:32  <foobio> hub_cap: and then adding jobs for it in zuul's layout.yaml (assuming you already have the python-jobs group for the project in jjb config)
2013-10-23T15:49:59  <hub_cap> its for troveclient foobio, im sure we do (just not the 33 gating yet)

2013-10-23T15:51:09  <dprince> dachary: SmokeStack uses upstream packages from master (currently running what will be Icehouse). So if you are interested making sure puppet-ceph works with the next release consider that. If you want to test that puppet-ceph works with the previous OS release then you could roll your own.
2013-10-23T15:51:29  *** SergeyLukjanov has joined #openstack-infra
2013-10-23T15:52:39  <mgagne> dachary, foobio: my understanding is that openstack infra is provided for openstack related projects. puppet-ceph isn't directly related to openstack and I don't feel comfortable requesting cloud resources to run integration tests for a project which isn't directly related to openstack itself and this could ultimately result in some form of abuse on the long term.
2013-10-23T15:53:14  <mgagne> dachary, foobio: if integration tests are running on a 3rd party infra, I wouldn't mind.
2013-10-23T15:53:17  *** jergerber has quit IRC
2013-10-23T15:55:04  <dachary> mgagne: ok. I was not such much looking for a plateform. Rather a method to setup integration tests independantly.
2013-10-23T15:55:20  <mgagne> dachary: in that case, I don't mind.
2013-10-23T15:56:06  <dachary>  I understand your concerns and 90% of the integration tests of puppet-ceph will indeed be about testing ceph deployment itself. Only 10% of it or less will be about integration testing ceph against openstack.
2013-10-23T15:56:10  <mgagne> dachary: documentation is sufficient regarding that aspect. we can ask dprince for details based on his experience with smokestack and grenade.
2013-10-23T15:56:33  *** miqui has joined #openstack-infra
2013-10-23T15:56:59  <dachary> if we were to use smokestack as dprince suggests, it could be seen as an abuse of the openstack project resources.
2013-10-23T15:57:05  <miqui> @superbee: noticed gearman does not get installed as part of the overall zuul install...
2013-10-23T15:57:29  <dachary> mgagne: which documentation ?
2013-10-23T15:57:37  <miqui> is this  a part is missing ?
2013-10-23T15:57:38  <mgagne> dachary: http://ci.openstack.org/third_party.html
2013-10-23T15:58:24  <foobio> miqui: the gear library should be all zuul needs for its gearman support. it already has a built-in lightweight gearman server
2013-10-23T15:58:51  <dachary> mgagne: yes, indeed. What I'm looking for is something that I could use instead of writing the scripts described here : https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Puppet-openstack/ceph-blueprint#Integration_tests
2013-10-23T15:59:05  <dachary> I'm happy to write code but not when it already exists somewhere ;-)
2013-10-23T15:59:10  <dprince> dachary: with SmokeStack I've typically focussed only on core OS projects. Puppet: outside of core is an exception though. But to really make it fit in SmokeStack someone would have to chase Ceph too because we'd need upstream packages for it as well.

2013-10-23T16:48:53  <ArxCruz> superbee: it's my next step, i will create other scripts based on openstack
2013-10-23T16:49:16  <superbee> I think we would accept updates to our scripts to make them run on either ubuntu or fedora though
2013-10-23T16:49:18  <ArxCruz> if everything works, i will propose to add it on openstack-infra project, if someone would like to run on fedora :)
2013-10-23T16:49:25  <superbee> (or maybe a second set of scripts, either way)

2013-10-23T18:04:08  <superbee> wow
2013-10-23T18:04:33  <markwash> well apparently support for certain formats is just a "minor release" for iso8601 so yeah
2013-10-23T18:04:47  <superbee> should that feedback be pushed back to iso8601? my understanding is that they are making the parser more flexible which in general is a good thing?
2013-10-23T18:05:05  <superbee> but maybe they should have a backward compat flag or something
2013-10-23T18:05:11  <markwash> superbee: yeah, I mean, that's the only way in which glance would change too, so maybe its not a huge deal?

2013-10-23T18:22:13  <markwash> sdague: what happened is they added support for several date formats for their date-time parsing

2013-10-23T18:22:42  <markwash> so things that formerly were unacceptable (and that we happened to test for) are now acceptable
2013-10-23T18:23:25  <markwash> sdague: the real issue for users is that, if their cloud somehow switches from 0.1.8 back to 0.1.4, then some formats they used to use for changes-since will throw 400 errors
2013-10-23T18:23:52  <markwash> sdague: the issue for us is that to make it so that the new formats work regardless, we basically are reimplementing a significant chunk of 0.1.8
2013-10-23T18:24:02  <sdague> markwash: so would it make sense to push everyone forward to 0.1.8 instead?
2013-10-23T18:24:24  <markwash> sdague: from my perspective yes, but I respect the packaging issues that might say otherwise
2013-10-23T18:24:25  <sdague> I think that might be a valid argument to make on the list

2013-10-23T18:35:46  <sdague> ok
2013-10-23T18:35:51  <superbee> sdague: it doesn't send that data today, and I don't think there is an easy way to make it a build parameter (which would be automagically picked up)
2013-10-23T18:36:06  <superbee> sdague: don't want you to think I forgot about it :)
2013-10-23T18:36:13  <sdague> so do we need the build slave name to get the az?
2013-10-23T18:36:22  <foobio> my only concern is that, e.g., ubuntu only has 0.1.4 and some projects are going to throw a minor fit if, for the sake of requirements consistency, they're expected to falsely claim they lack support for the iso8601 in ubuntu
2013-10-23T18:36:24  <superbee> sdague: pretty much as that is where we have encoded that data
2013-10-23T18:36:27  <sdague> ok
2013-10-23T18:36:55  <sdague> foobio: well, we're talking 14.04 by the time icehouse is out anyway
2013-10-23T18:37:49  <superbee> hmm the build slave is in the console log, maybe I can pull it out of that snale
2013-10-23T18:37:51  <superbee> *sanely
2013-10-23T18:37:55  <foobio> sure, i guess we're on the cusp of their lts transition, so zul will just have to make sure it comes with new enough iso8601 by then ;)
2013-10-23T18:38:03  <superbee> but really probably would be easiest to have the event publisher just publish the info

2013-10-23T19:06:10  <lifeless> superbee: e.g. the way things stand in our code it's a terrible idea.
2013-10-23T19:06:35  <lifeless> we don't test mixed versions in use at the moment
2013-10-23T19:07:06  <lifeless> it's highly likely someone will add a dependency on the new feature and then some poor schmuck will end up spending a week tracking down whats wrong
2013-10-23T19:07:28  <superbee> lifeless: so preferable to just require >=0.1.8?

2013-10-23T20:16:27  <ArxCruz> :)
2013-10-23T20:16:41  <sdague> superbee: so under tenant isolation we create a new tenant for each test class
2013-10-23T20:17:23  <sdague> which is needed for parallel, otherwise different test classes would be under the same tenant, and it would be impossible to have sane start states
2013-10-23T20:17:59  <superbee> sdague: I see.
2013-10-23T20:18:02  <sdague> and you'd end up possibly doing crazy things like having one test kill a different tests servers
2013-10-23T20:18:21  <superbee> sdague: mtreinish: any reason for chosing the pg-isolated test over the mysql isolated test for tempest gating?
2013-10-23T20:18:21  <sdague> if they are tenant isolated, the security protections in openstack should prevent that
2013-10-23T20:18:31  <superbee> sdague: gotcha
2013-10-23T20:18:34  <sdague> superbee: only because the non isolated case is mysql
2013-10-23T20:18:46  <sdague> so it gives us slightly better coverage
2013-10-23T20:18:57  <superbee> ok
2013-10-23T20:18:58  <mtreinish> superbee: the issues is that with neutron we need networking to be created for each tenant too for anything created in the tenant to work

2013-10-23T21:11:39  <reed> btw, we should probably push the code I use up somewhere so others can fix it :)
2013-10-23T21:11:54  <reed> currently it's a simple script that ttx made
2013-10-23T21:12:15  <openstackgerrit> Mark Washenberger proposed a change to openstack/requirements: require iso8601>=0.1.8  https://review.openstack.org/53455
2013-10-23T21:13:22  *** atiwari has joined #openstack-infra
2013-10-23T21:13:41  <foobio> reed: superbee: inability to sort messages in chronological order, identify duplicate messages and construct proper references for threading, off the top of my head ;)
2013-10-23T21:15:02  <foobio> also, lack of conformance to rfc821/822 and their successors, though i'm not in a position to quote from them at the moment to prove my case
2013-10-23T21:15:36  <reed> foobio, my client sorts by date that message
2013-10-23T21:15:45  *** jergerber has joined #openstack-infra
2013-10-23T21:16:00  <reed> anyway, I think it needs to be fixed
2013-10-23T21:16:20  <foobio> yeah, the mta probably adds a guessed date header when it finds a missing one, but strict in what you send and loose in what you accept and all
2013-10-23T21:16:34  <reed> foobio, maybe that code should stay with the code that extracts the list of ATCs?
2013-10-23T21:16:37  <superbee> oh man, my favorite thing is when my parents send me mail and MUAs use that date and I get mail from the future
2013-10-23T21:17:15  <reed> superbee, yeah, email clients suck
2013-10-23T21:17:34  <foobio> reed: possibly. worth discussing at any rate (though right now we just have it crammed into openstack-infra/config)

2013-10-23T21:32:02  <anteaya> poor email clients unable to deal with the date line
2013-10-23T21:32:07  <superbee> (I think I did that math correctly)
2013-10-23T21:32:18  <anteaya> sounds about right
2013-10-23T21:35:27  <foobio> those are some poor e-mail clients indeed if they can't deal with timezone calculations. i thought this was why we had computers in the first place
2013-10-23T21:35:45  <mtreinish> superbee, foobio: what's the best way to handle submitting a patch reverting a revert?
2013-10-23T21:36:07  <foobio> mtreinish: i would just git revert the revert change
2013-10-23T21:36:21  *** mriedem has quit IRC
2013-10-23T21:36:31  <foobio> mtreinish: but make sure to clear out any existing change-id header with a --amend
2013-10-23T21:37:13  <mtreinish> foobio: ok that's really what I was asking I guess is whether the original patch (the one that was reverted) change-id should be used
2013-10-23T21:37:56  <foobio> mtreinish: you don't ever want to reuse a change-id on the same branch
2013-10-23T21:38:33  <foobio> i think gerrit actually won't let you (should get a "change is closed" error on the push)

2013-10-23T21:51:33  <superbee> zaro: just devstack slaves
2013-10-23T21:51:50  <superbee> static slaves aren't managed by nodepool currently so don't show up in its numbers
2013-10-23T21:52:26  <zaro> superbee: thanks.  also do you know the config of our jenkins slaves (# cpu  & memory?)
2013-10-23T21:52:37  <superbee> 8GB 4VCPU
2013-10-23T21:52:59  <superbee> that is true of most of the slaves (I think only the special publishing and proposal slaves are different, they are smaller)
2013-10-23T21:53:11  <zaro> superbee: ohh how about the master?
2013-10-23T21:53:54  <superbee> the masters are 30GB 8VCPU
2013-10-23T21:55:51  <superbee> zaro: gerrit is 30GB 8VCPU as well

2013-10-23T22:48:28  <hcc> superbee, understood... my concern is that the my username in gerrit doesn't map to anything in my lp profile, and it could cause confusion
2013-10-23T22:49:48  <reed> uhm ... now that I pushed that script up, I realize that I need to mess up with .gitignore before I can use it from my folder
2013-10-23T22:50:13  <reed> can I create a .gitignore per directory level?
2013-10-23T22:50:22  <superbee> reed: no they live at a project or global level
2013-10-23T22:50:27  <reed> damn
2013-10-23T22:50:49  <superbee> you can put relative paths in the project level ignore though
2013-10-23T22:50:56  <superbee> I think
2013-10-23T22:51:21  <superbee> which might allow you to approximate what you want

2013-10-23T22:55:42  <foobio> which is why we prefer not to under normal circumstances
2013-10-23T22:56:07  <foobio> after all, you set it once in your global git config and never have to worry about it again
2013-10-23T22:57:53  <hcc> foobio, is there an easy way to see if the username I'd like, hcc, is available?
2013-10-23T22:58:04  <hcc> if not, I'll just stick with what's in there now

2013-10-23T23:20:23  <superbee> jerryz: I think mgagne, ran into this problem. There is an option you have to toggle globally to make it apply to the console.html maybe?
2013-10-23T23:20:40  <superbee> we work around it by having an older version of the plugin, but I believe you just have to click a switch to make it work on the newer version
