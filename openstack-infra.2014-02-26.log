2014-02-26T00:18:13  <sdague> jbooboo: any chance we could figure out how far behind we are in logstash instead of just queue depth?

2014-02-26T00:20:01  <sdague> jbooboo: yeh, basically
2014-02-26T00:20:20  <quantumfly> sdague: you can figure that out with a simple es query
2014-02-26T00:20:32  <quantumfly> just look for the last console.html timestamp essentially
2014-02-26T00:20:43  <quantumfly> which is probably more accurate than depth -> time
2014-02-26T00:20:43  <jbooboo> sdague: oh, yeah, i guess there's two things related to time...
2014-02-26T00:20:55  <sdague> quantumfly: true
2014-02-26T00:21:10  <jbooboo> sdague: quantumfly described "what's the most recent entry", and now-then is how far behind we are...
2014-02-26T00:21:15  <sdague> that would be a nice thing to have a running graph for, as that would give us an idea on the impact
2014-02-26T00:21:27  <jbooboo> sdague: but there's also "how long do we have to catch up?"
2014-02-26T00:21:39  <jbooboo> sdague: which is a function of queue depth and a variable

2014-02-26T00:24:57  <jbooboo> sdague: at any rate, queue depth should at least shed some visibility on it -- i mean, when things are working as planned, the queue shouldn't be more than a few hundred or maybe thousand.
2014-02-26T00:25:11  <sdague> ok, so 90k... bad?

2014-02-26T00:53:27  <foobio> if it's package install related, at least it's only a concern for first bootstrap

2014-02-26T00:55:01  <quantumfly> so coordinated upgrades all at once is a good thing after having stopped all the nodes

2014-02-26T00:55:31  <quantumfly> but salt and all that need to happen first
2014-02-26T00:56:01  <foobio> i guess there's not enough redundancy to upgrade half the cluster offline and pivor

2014-02-26T00:59:53  <quantumfly> there is no enforcement of when things can merge and so on, its all manual behind the scenes
2014-02-26T00:59:57  <quantumfly> that
2014-02-26T00:59:59  <Ryan_Lane> I think it does now
2014-02-26T01:00:12  <jbooboo> Ryan_Lane: neato, maybe we should look again.
2014-02-26T01:00:14  <foobio> they've replaced hadn-waving with mechanical hands?
2014-02-26T01:00:14  <Ryan_Lane> that was my major hesitation too
2014-02-26T01:00:49  <Ryan_Lane> and lyft is considering it and I'd really like to use something that has zuul integration :D
2014-02-26T01:01:20  *** wenlock has quit IRC
2014-02-26T01:01:24  <Ryan_Lane> wikimedia will obviously need zuul integration too

2014-02-26T01:02:14  <quantumfly> ooh I would defnitely be willing to look at it again
2014-02-26T01:02:15  <jbooboo> Ryan_Lane: we'll definitely accept zuul patches for it (supporting non-gerrit is considered in-scope for zuul) even if we don't switch (ever or for a while)
2014-02-26T01:02:24  <Ryan_Lane> cool
2014-02-26T01:02:41  <foobio> non-gerrit, much like non-jenkins, means non-jave potentially

2014-02-26T01:03:39  <jbooboo> Ryan_Lane: so are you at the "gap analysis" phase or more like the "let's poke at this" phase?
2014-02-26T01:03:55  <Ryan_Lane> it's installed in our labs environment and people are poking around at it
2014-02-26T01:04:00  <foobio> phabricator is written in php... guess i'll still have that to hold against it
2014-02-26T01:04:08  <Ryan_Lane> at lyft we're at the gap analysis phase
2014-02-26T01:04:14  <mspreitz> foobio: read all the way down, the problem is not the software it is something in the network and many kinds of software can trigger it
2014-02-26T01:04:15  <Ryan_Lane> it's easier to deal with php than java :)

2014-02-26T01:07:40  <quantumfly> jhesketh: is that intentional?
2014-02-26T01:07:51  <quantumfly> jhesketh: oh wait I grok now nevermind

2014-02-26T01:11:53  <quantumfly> jhesketh: I am feeling dense. how does worker_name which is in the default list match the worker.name key?
2014-02-26T01:11:59  <anteaya> no don't get started on anything blinky
2014-02-26T01:12:14  <quantumfly> jhesketh: wouldn't that fail to match removing worker_name from fields?
2014-02-26T01:12:15  <jhesketh> quantumfly: ah, it wouldn't.. that'd be an error from a previous patchset
2014-02-26T01:12:39  <quantumfly> jhesketh: so I should leave a legit comment on that?
2014-02-26T01:12:48  <foobio> quantumfly: so with the fix in place, es03 tried to double-start and oom'd too
2014-02-26T01:12:49  <jhesketh> yep
2014-02-26T01:13:06  <jhesketh> quantumfly: so it was worker_name, and the job had 'worker_name', 'worker_ips' etc in the dict, but now it goes job['worker']['names']
2014-02-26T01:13:09  <quantumfly> foobio: weird I have no idea why that would happen
2014-02-26T01:13:15  <quantumfly> foobio: oh you know what
2014-02-26T01:13:17  *** sarob has quit IRC
2014-02-26T01:13:20  <quantumfly> foobio: is it double forking?
2014-02-26T01:13:40  <quantumfly> foobio: we might want to set HEAP_SIZE to 29g if so
2014-02-26T01:13:40  <foobio> it... might be? i dunno, java and all
2014-02-26T01:14:09  <foobio> as long as it stays inside its jvm, it can fork itself all it likes
2014-02-26T01:14:30  <quantumfly> jhesketh: I will finish reviewing this and leave comments
2014-02-26T01:14:35  <jhesketh> cheerws
2014-02-26T01:14:37  <jhesketh> *cheers
2014-02-26T01:15:09  <foobio> but yeah, i suppose leaving it a little room for briefly doubling its memory footprint, while somewhat insane from a memory utilization perspective, is certainly doable
2014-02-26T01:15:54  <foobio> quantumfly: though if that were really the case, i'd expect to hit it any time we started the service, not just the first time around
2014-02-26T01:16:06  *** zhiyan_ is now known as zhiyan
2014-02-26T01:16:14  <quantumfly> foobio: right and on the old nodes we set heap size to 16GB on 30GB nodes so should hit it every time
2014-02-26T01:16:18  <quantumfly> so I really don't know what is going on
2014-02-26T01:16:31  * foobio blames puppet some more, fir good measure

2014-02-26T01:16:58  <quantumfly> I will be going to an es + logstash thing early march in seattle maybe they will know there if we don't get it sorted before then
2014-02-26T01:17:10  <sdague> Ryan_Lane: so I'm looking at the phabricator site. I wonder how it would deal with openstack review load. They look like they are at 8k reviews total in their system, and I think that's currently about 5 weeks for us.
2014-02-26T01:18:01  <foobio> interestingly, at start it immediately gobbles as much cache in ram as it uses resident
2014-02-26T01:18:18  <foobio> is that just a javaism, or elasticsearch-specific behavior?
2014-02-26T01:18:35  <quantumfly> I thin es specific
2014-02-26T01:18:46  <openstackgerrit> James E. Blair proposed a change to openstack-infra/config: Add storyboard and openstackid-dev ssl certs  https://review.openstack.org/76407

2014-02-26T01:22:46  <sdague> Ryan_Lane: it would be really interesting to see if you can make a sane integration here. Because as much as I have issues with gerrit, I also look at what
2014-02-26T01:22:51  <jhesketh> quantumfly: it's similar but a lot more information has been added into the jobs list to better reflect the data model
2014-02-26T01:23:19  <sdague> 's in the public phabricator, and my gerrit workflow, and can't imagine getting that interface to handle my workflow
2014-02-26T01:23:44  <Ryan_Lane> I think pre-merge workflow is similar
2014-02-26T01:23:54  <Ryan_Lane> what's different about it?
2014-02-26T01:23:59  <sdague> the review view

2014-02-26T01:24:48  <Ryan_Lane> anything specific missing?
2014-02-26T01:25:00  <mspreitz> New question: how do I make git tell me where my FETCH_HEAD is pointing?

2014-02-26T01:25:28  <jbooboo> git show FETCH_HEAD
2014-02-26T01:25:35  <foobio> that ^
2014-02-26T01:26:11  <mspreitz> $ git show FETCH_HEAD fatal: ambiguous argument 'FETCH_HEAD': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
2014-02-26T01:26:11  <foobio> or you can git checkout FETCH_HEAD and then just git show
2014-02-26T01:26:26  <foobio> mspreitz: is that before or after a fetch?
2014-02-26T01:26:34  <mspreitz> after a fetch

2014-02-26T01:34:05  <quantumfly> jbooboo: if jhesketh's change still lg to you we can rpobably double tab it and get it merged

2014-02-26T01:34:38  <sdague> Ryan_Lane: reasonable queries is definitely key, honestly gerrit only partially works that way. Having the queries as get strings so you can bookmark them is goodness as well.
2014-02-26T01:34:42  <foobio> anteaya: good point. my present watched backlog is at least triple that i think
2014-02-26T01:35:01  <Ryan_Lane> looks like phabricator can save queries

2014-02-26T01:37:03  <quantumfly> jesusaurus: ya not sure if init script/es fault or puppet double tapping weird
2014-02-26T01:37:20  <foobio> jesusaurus: use out puppet, and build a new cluster member?

2014-02-26T01:37:40  <Ryan_Lane> oh, wow. phabricator's task manager works across projects: https://secure.phabricator.com/T3089
2014-02-26T01:37:58  <Ryan_Lane> isn't that the reason launchpad is still being used for issues?

2014-02-26T01:38:43  <Ryan_Lane> it's a feature of jira too
2014-02-26T01:38:52  <Ryan_Lane> so it's not insane at all
2014-02-26T01:39:08  <jbooboo> Ryan_Lane: mordred and ttx can probably provide more details, but there was still some fundamental misalignments between phabricator and what we need

2014-02-26T01:39:15  <jbooboo> and blueprints

2014-02-26T01:42:13  <foobio> quantumfly: jesusaurus: and that puppet agent --test did indeed wind up trying to start a second jvm, which then got oom-killed
2014-02-26T01:42:54  <foobio> and following a service stop/start, it joined the cluster normally and successfully
2014-02-26T01:44:08  <quantumfly> so new theory. package install starts it then service double taps
2014-02-26T01:44:17  <jesusaurus> foobio: before that --test run es04 already had elasticsearch installed and running?
2014-02-26T01:44:26  <foobio> quantumfly: jesusaurus: staring at that log, i'm back to my original supposition, which is that the initscript returns control to the calling process before the pidfile is created
2014-02-26T01:44:27  <jesusaurus> quantumfly: oh, thats a possibility
2014-02-26T01:44:51  <quantumfly> foobio: can you try a test change that doesnt manage the service?
2014-02-26T01:44:56  <foobio> jesusaurus: before that the elasticsearch puppet module was not applied at all
2014-02-26T01:45:07  <foobio> quantumfly: doing now

2014-02-26T01:53:20  <foobio> quantumfly: as suspected, https://review.openstack.org/76412 there seems to solve it
2014-02-26T01:53:28  <foobio> so my first theory was probably correct
2014-02-26T01:53:39  <quantumfly> ya I think so
2014-02-26T01:53:57  <sdague> jbooboo: sigh
2014-02-26T01:54:31  <foobio> quantumfly: if we merge that, i'll puppet es06 from master with it, make sure that is sane, and call it a day
2014-02-26T01:54:34  <sdague> I wonder if we are ever going to get rid of our CLA, or if that will be the board fight to end all board fights
2014-02-26T01:54:48  <foobio> sdague: the tc should fire the board
2014-02-26T01:54:56  <foobio> ;)
2014-02-26T01:54:58  <quantumfly> foobio: I +2'd it. Looks relatively safe. I did not however check to see if there were subscriptions to the service or notifies to it
2014-02-26T01:55:14  <quantumfly> sdague: you could fork openstack and have the fork be CLA free
2014-02-26T01:55:46  <foobio> quantumfly: well, i did apply the same change from a puppet dev env on es05 and it didn't error. i think a subscrive/refresh would have counted as a reference to a nonexistent service and errored in that case
2014-02-26T01:56:10  <quantumfly> foobio: maybe
2014-02-26T01:56:13  * quantumfly looks closer

2014-02-26T01:57:01  <foobio> quantumfly: if there's any mention of a service, it's not in the init.pp anyway (which is the only puppetfile in the module)
2014-02-26T01:57:21  <quantumfly> foobio: git grep "'elasticsearch'" doesn't show any incidences either

2014-02-26T03:01:34  <fifieldt> probably
2014-02-26T03:04:07  <pleia2> it's tough because none of the versions of Ubuntu that can a) run modern openstack can b) easily run python 2.6, the last release that met this criteria was 11.10/oneiric (now EOL)
2014-02-26T03:04:28  <pleia2> which is why we use centos to test 2.6 in the infra now
2014-02-26T03:05:51  <mspreitz> Ah, thanks
2014-02-26T03:06:04  <mspreitz> So developers normally use Ubuntu 12.04 and test with only Python 2.7, right?
2014-02-26T03:06:59  <pleia2> we also have 3.3 packages for 12.04 that we test some things on, but yeah, 2.7 is the status quo

2014-02-26T06:46:40  <mordred> Ryan_Lane: yeah - it doesn't do bug tasks though (which is why we're still on launchpad and writing storyboard) - and its integrated code review makes it hard for us to use it integrated with gerrit
2014-02-26T06:46:58  <mordred> Ryan_Lane: but yea - I found it very tempting when looking at it and I tried to make it make sense to use it

2014-02-26T06:50:38  <quantumfly> er I guess it is beta. Does that mean the merge in phabricator is beta?

2014-02-26T08:19:04  <Ryan_Lane> totally agree :)
2014-02-26T08:19:05  <mordred> Ryan_Lane: we'd need to add an event stream so that zuul could do its thing
2014-02-26T08:19:19  <Ryan_Lane> yep. wikimedia is considering phabricator again
2014-02-26T08:19:24  <Ryan_Lane> so some of this would be needed by them too
2014-02-26T08:19:34  <mordred> ah. they don't want to use storyboard from us?
2014-02-26T08:19:44  <Ryan_Lane> they use bugzilla
2014-02-26T08:19:49  <Ryan_Lane> they don't really need a bug tracker
2014-02-26T08:19:52  <mordred> oh
2014-02-26T08:19:59  <Ryan_Lane> they want to replace gerrit
2014-02-26T08:20:00  <mordred> so why would they want to move to phabricator?
2014-02-26T08:20:02  <mordred> ah
2014-02-26T08:20:05  <mordred> well, that would make me sad
2014-02-26T08:20:08  *** jgallard has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-26T08:20:16  <Ryan_Lane> gerrit has a pretty unresponsive upstream
2014-02-26T08:20:22  <Ryan_Lane> it's UX is crap
2014-02-26T08:20:26  <Ryan_Lane> its*
2014-02-26T08:20:33  <mordred> we have some thoughts on UX for gerrit, fwiw
2014-02-26T08:20:39  <Ryan_Lane> its UX is consistently getting worse
2014-02-26T08:20:42  <mordred> which don't involve upstream patches
2014-02-26T08:20:43  <Ryan_Lane> have you seen the new change page?
2014-02-26T08:20:46  <mordred> yes
2014-02-26T08:21:03  <Ryan_Lane> the only thing gerrit does really well is handle the repos
2014-02-26T08:21:10  <mordred> right. but that's the hard part
2014-02-26T08:21:11  <Ryan_Lane> well, and its gating model
2014-02-26T08:21:13  <mordred> a UI can be added
2014-02-26T08:21:19  <Ryan_Lane> phabricator now handles repos
2014-02-26T08:21:20  <mordred> on top of its APIs
2014-02-26T08:21:54  <Ryan_Lane> gerrits public APIs kind of suck :(
2014-02-26T08:22:11  <mordred> the ssh api is actually quite amazing
2014-02-26T08:22:24  <Ryan_Lane> yeah, the ssh api isn't bad, but I wouldn't build a UI on it
2014-02-26T08:22:26  <mordred> in that it allows the effects of event/callback without the receiving end needingto be pulic
2014-02-26T08:22:28  *** gokrokve has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-26T08:22:49  <mordred> like, from the event stream perspective - this makes the "run a 3rd party testing" thing work really well
2014-02-26T08:22:57  <Ryan_Lane> I honestly think moving away from gerrit is such a major undertaking that wikimedia may not do it
2014-02-26T08:23:03  <Ryan_Lane> but at some point something's got to change
2014-02-26T08:23:04  <mordred> yeah. it's a BIG amount of work
2014-02-26T08:23:07  <mordred> yeah
2014-02-26T08:23:10  <mordred> well, we're with you on that :)
2014-02-26T08:23:17  <Ryan_Lane> gerrit either needs to improve, or it's got to go
2014-02-26T08:23:30  <mordred> I'm basically being me right now because we agree and would love to work together on that
2014-02-26T08:23:39  <Ryan_Lane> heh
2014-02-26T08:24:08  <mordred> from my perspective, I'd like to replace teh UI first, which would mean that gerrit would be down to being the repo engine
2014-02-26T08:24:09  <Ryan_Lane> I think wikimedia is likely to investigate it for a while
2014-02-26T08:24:14  *** denis_makogon has quit IRC
2014-02-26T08:24:19  <mordred> then replacing the repo engine would be much easier
2014-02-26T08:24:26  <Ryan_Lane> yeah, but at that point, why not use phabricator?
2014-02-26T08:24:35  <mordred> because we can do it piecemeal
2014-02-26T08:24:42  <mordred> like we've been working towards replacing jenkins
2014-02-26T08:24:47  <mordred> even while adding jenkins features
2014-02-26T08:24:55  <mordred> because we've gota  large production deploy
2014-02-26T08:25:05  <Ryan_Lane> ah, so you'd switch out the ui, then you'd switch to phabricator?
2014-02-26T08:25:07  <mordred> we can't just replace a large porition all in one go
2014-02-26T08:25:09  <mordred> no
2014-02-26T08:25:10  <Ryan_Lane> then you'd switch the ui again?
2014-02-26T08:25:20  <mordred> I wouldn't switch to phabricator at that point
2014-02-26T08:25:28  <Ryan_Lane> what would manage the repos?
2014-02-26T08:25:40  <Ryan_Lane> I think phabricator is doing an amazing job with the UI work
2014-02-26T08:25:44  <mordred> that's what I'm saying - at that point, what we'd need is an api service that can manage repos
2014-02-26T08:26:03  <mordred> sure they are - but they're also a big thing adn I don't need most of what they're doing
2014-02-26T08:26:05  <mordred> it's too hard
2014-02-26T08:26:11  <mordred> if we were starting from scratch today, sure
2014-02-26T08:26:16  * Ryan_Lane nods
2014-02-26T08:26:27  <mordred> but they're pitching a whole worldview
2014-02-26T08:26:30  <mordred> which is great
2014-02-26T08:26:32  <Ryan_Lane> so basically write something new from scratch?
2014-02-26T08:26:33  <mordred> it's what we're doing too
2014-02-26T08:26:34  <mordred> yeah
2014-02-26T08:26:39  <mordred> all we'd need is an api server
2014-02-26T08:26:41  <Ryan_Lane> that scares me ;)
2014-02-26T08:26:45  <mordred> we're good at writing those around here
2014-02-26T08:27:01  <Ryan_Lane> an api server that would manage repos?
2014-02-26T08:27:05  <mordred> yeah
2014-02-26T08:27:14  *** gokrokve has quit IRC
2014-02-26T08:27:25  <Ryan_Lane> well, it would surely be nice to have a python alternative
2014-02-26T08:27:30  <mordred> or, a scale-out system that can manage repos across multiple hosts - gerrit it too monolithic
2014-02-26T08:27:32  <mordred> is
2014-02-26T08:27:41  <Ryan_Lane> I just worry that it would take ages to reach feature parity with gerrit or phabricator
2014-02-26T08:27:47  <mordred> I agree
2014-02-26T08:27:53  <mordred> the question is - which features do we actually need
2014-02-26T08:28:12  <Ryan_Lane> ah. so... I've been thinking about scaling git across systems...
2014-02-26T08:28:28  <mordred> and/or which ones can we do away with if we're not working on a generalized solution that needs a bunch of customizability
2014-02-26T08:28:30  <mordred> yeah
2014-02-26T08:28:32  <mordred> ?
2014-02-26T08:28:38  <Ryan_Lane> but I'll just wait till I have something implemented till I discuss it :)
2014-02-26T08:28:49  <mordred> ok. I'm in favor of thoughts on scaling git
2014-02-26T08:29:00  <mordred> Ryan_Lane: have you been following the recent zuul merger work?
2014-02-26T08:29:04  <Ryan_Lane> nope
2014-02-26T08:29:16  <Ryan_Lane> but I have a deployment system using salt that can easily be extended to scale out git
2014-02-26T08:29:35  <Ryan_Lane> and already have a game plan for making it work for that
2014-02-26T08:29:44  <Ryan_Lane> what does zuul merger do?
2014-02-26T08:29:58  * Ryan_Lane is very interested in zuul, but can't use it

2014-02-26T11:25:21  <katyafervent> Hi everybody!
2014-02-26T11:25:26  *** rcarrillocruz has quit IRC
2014-02-26T11:27:14  *** gokrokve has quit IRC
2014-02-26T11:27:31  <katyafervent> Does anyone have experience in renaming repository? Will history be saved?
2014-02-26T11:30:07  <SergeyLukjanov> katyafervent, hey
2014-02-26T11:30:21  <SergeyLukjanov> katyafervent, are you talking about your murano repos at stackforge?
2014-02-26T11:30:32  <katyafervent> SergeyLukjanov, yes)
2014-02-26T11:31:21  <katyafervent> we want to start repository reorganization but want history to be kept
2014-02-26T11:31:48  <SergeyLukjanov> katyafervent, review history will be saved, but renaming requires gerrit shutdown, so, it'll be postponed and batched with other renaming requests
2014-02-26T11:32:16  <SergeyLukjanov> I think the next renaming batch will be for renaming savanna
2014-02-26T11:32:47  <SergeyLukjanov> katyafervent, if you'd like to merge some repos and keep their review history than I think that it's impossible
2014-02-26T11:32:51  *** jhesketh has quit IRC
2014-02-26T11:33:18  <ruhe> katyafervent: another option would be to create new repo named "murano". merge all the other repos to the new repo, then remove/deprecate old repos
2014-02-26T11:33:39  <SergeyLukjanov> ruhe, yup

2014-02-26T11:34:53  <SergeyLukjanov> katyafervent, if you'd like to keep git history the only way is to manually merge git trees with help of git-filter-branch
2014-02-26T11:35:04  <katyafervent> and what about commit history?

2014-02-26T14:14:58  <foobio> er
2014-02-26T14:15:11  <foobio> the "Build succeeded." there implies that zuul reported it as a success
2014-02-26T14:15:30  <foobio> because all the jobs were non-voting\

2014-02-26T14:16:36  <foobio> ArxCruz: i think if you changed one or more of those jobs to be a voting job, the way your layout.yaml is configured zuul will add a comment (but not a vote) on success and will do nothing on failure

2014-02-26T14:16:59  <ArxCruz> foobio: let me save this conversation :P
2014-02-26T14:17:04  <ArxCruz> I will do that :)
2014-02-26T14:17:28  <foobio> right now it's commenting because you've configured it to leave a comment on success, and with all jobs non-voting, any run will be interpreted by zuul as a success even if the jobs themselves failed (because they're non-voting jobs)
2014-02-26T14:17:57  <ArxCruz> got it
2014-02-26T14:18:37  <foobio> "non-voting" for a job merely indicates whether it contributes to the completion result, but the actual verified: 1 or -1 is what causes zuul itself to leave a vote
2014-02-26T14:18:41  <ArxCruz> ok, so, if I mark one job as voting, it will report, only if both jobs success, or it will report if the voting one succeed ?
2014-02-26T14:19:02  *** julim has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-26T14:19:24  <foobio> the way you have it configured right now, any one voting job which fails will cause your zuul not to comment
2014-02-26T14:19:26  *** vponomaryov has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-26T14:19:37  <foobio> even if one or more other voting jobs succeed
2014-02-26T14:20:05  <foobio> basically as long as at least one voting job fails, zuul considers the overall result to be a failure
2014-02-26T14:20:21  <foobio> if all voting jobs succeed, zuul considers that to be a success
2014-02-26T14:20:30  *** bknudson has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-26T14:20:37  <foobio> if no jobs are voting, zuul interprets that as a success as well

2014-02-26T15:46:37  <foobio> VINOD: that's an extremely large change (over 3000 lines). it's unlikely you'll find anyone actually reviewing it unless you break it up into smaller, more manageable patches

2014-02-26T15:51:49  <foobio> SergeyLukjanov: the zuul layout test will, however, do some sanity checks on changes like yours
2014-02-26T15:52:05  <jbooboo> SergeyLukjanov: if you look at the output of the layout test, it prints zuul's final configuration

2014-02-26T16:09:10  <dansmith> given that a simple error could report incorrectly on a hundred patches before it goes noticed, I don't think making them comment on each one is very reasonable

2014-02-26T16:24:21  <anteaya> since opensource is a philosphy as much as code, consistent action helps to inform the philosphy

2014-02-26T17:00:13  <davidlenwell> So here is a question .. how do I change the topic on an already commited review without changing something? to satisfy this? http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2014-February/028130.html

2014-02-26T17:39:23  <sdague> because I feel like we've had some much more inconsistent allocations recently, so it would be good to nail that down
2014-02-26T17:39:32  <jbooboo> what do you mean?
2014-02-26T17:40:08  <sdague> like head of gate queue not getting resources until most of the rest of it did
2014-02-26T17:40:26  *** krotscheck has quit IRC

2014-02-26T17:42:50  <jbooboo> sdague: as you know, jenkins fails to complete builds for reasons of its own quite a lot
2014-02-26T17:42:58  <sdague> yeh
2014-02-26T17:43:13  <jbooboo> sdague: some of those are detectable by zuul.  in those cases, zuul will re-enqueue the job to give jenkins a chance at another go.
2014-02-26T17:43:36  <jbooboo> sdague: unfortunatly, that means the jobs go to the back of the queue.  we can probably fix that, but it's non-trivial
2014-02-26T17:43:50  <jbooboo> sdague: (whereas just having it retry at the back of the queue was trivial, so we did it)

2014-02-26T17:51:43  <jbooboo> foobio, anteaya: the loop was caused because jenkins had previously submitted the patchset.  the submit counts as an approval that sticks around (it isn't reset by the 0 vote)

2014-02-26T17:53:25  <wendar> sdague: ah-ha
2014-02-26T17:53:30  <sdague> so we can't build a pattern out of it to see it's likeliness
2014-02-26T17:53:48  <sdague> it should be in the index now, though elastic search is still in a world of hurt

2014-02-26T17:53:59  <apevec> sdague, https://review.openstack.org/#/c/76020/2..3//COMMIT_MSG,unified - "gearman lost the job here" what does that mean?

2014-02-26T17:54:18  <sdague> wendar: yeh
2014-02-26T17:54:33  <sdague> so new jobs will both timestamp and index that log file
2014-02-26T17:54:39  <sdague> so we can use it in elastic recheck

2014-02-26T17:56:17  <foobio> apevec: in summary, for some reason as of yet unidentified (due to insufficient logging) zuul's gearman server lost track of the fact that it needed to request for a worker on the pep8 test for that change, so it was sitting at the top of the gate not clearing, and this preventing anything else from merging

2014-02-26T19:08:41  <jbooboo> dkranz: in devstack-gate they should be moved to 'tempest.conf.txt' and then gzipped

2014-02-26T19:19:16  <quantumfly> wendar: I think sdague is correct
2014-02-26T19:19:26  <jbooboo> dhellmann: or if py26-33 testing is more important, then we can go with an asymmetric gate (or even just non-voting tests) on the regular unit test nodes and forego the devstack-gate git repo setup
2014-02-26T19:19:59  <wendar> sdague: In Launchpad, the only "Adminstrator" in the Nova Bugs team is "OpenStack Administrators".
2014-02-26T19:20:00  <apevec> foobio, that's a good question, not sure that after 76058 is fixed, it won't break in some other place
2014-02-26T19:20:21  <dhellmann> jbooboo: the idea is to prevent breaking the other projects, which really means API changes. We do have unit tests for the lib by itself to verify we don't break py26 and py33, I was just being overly cautious
2014-02-26T19:20:28  <wendar> But then, maybe any team member has access to update that list.
2014-02-26T19:20:40  <apevec> e.g. this popped after skipping swift devstack exercises

2014-02-26T19:21:22  <dhellmann> jbooboo: and if we'll have the git repo checkout stuff working on unit test nodes at some point, we can add more test jobs then

2014-02-26T19:22:03  <jbooboo> dhellmann: okay.  i'll redo that change appropriately.  i'll just hard-code py27 for now.
2014-02-26T19:22:04  <foobio> apevec: i say we merge 76058 first, since it's already written, and then if it still doesn't help we go forward with 76280 and not waste more developer time on it
2014-02-26T19:22:19  <dhellmann> jbooboo: passing it to run_cross_tests.sh?
2014-02-26T19:22:40  <jbooboo> dhellmann: yeah, so the arg will already be there, and we can plumb it into jjb when we're actually ready to use it.
2014-02-26T19:22:48  <dhellmann> jbooboo: makes sense

2014-02-26T19:25:17  <foobio> quantumfly: did you do something earlier to put logstash-worker05 and 09 back into service? (i noticed last night they were missing in the status monitors)
2014-02-26T19:25:19  <jbooboo> dhellmann: yes.  one downside to that is we're missing some of the sanity checks that the run-unittests script gives us, but since these are essentially duplicate tests as far as that goes, we're probably okay.
2014-02-26T19:25:41  <jbooboo> dhellmann: (sanity checks like did it oom, or sudo, or run zero tests)
2014-02-26T19:25:53  <jbooboo> dhellmann: actually, that last one might be a good one to have in run_cross_tests

2014-02-26T19:32:12  <jbooboo> foobio: i think we found the ram/cpu sweet-spot last time with benchmarking.  of course, they are probably standard, not performance nodes.
2014-02-26T19:32:13  <jbooboo> quantumfly: yes.
2014-02-26T19:32:21  <quantumfly> they are standard

2014-02-26T19:33:03  <jbooboo> we should probably add one then take each of the other 4 out and replace them.

2014-02-26T19:45:11  <apevec> foobio, right, but they got integrate at Havana GA i.e. will be part of stable release in stable/icehouse cycle
2014-02-26T19:45:18  <foobio> apevec: if the goal is to only include projects which are under stable-maint in requirements integration, then that probably merits wider discussion

2014-02-26T19:46:56  <foobio> apevec: i believe currently the list of projects which are in requirements integration uses teh same list as the projects which wish to receive requirements sync updates, so there are a number of projects which are not official or even curently incubated in the list

2014-02-26T20:07:35  <quantumfly> so the way it works is that regexes are 'metajobs' these are applied to non regex names when they are declared
2014-02-26T20:07:49  <quantumfly> so you can just put the regex lines above the non regex lines and that should work

2014-02-26T20:26:29  <mtreinish> quantumfly, foobio, jbooboo: shouldn't that be pointed at the infra pypi mirror?: http://logs.openstack.org/35/76635/2/check/gate-elastic-recheck-pep8/b5a7e8c/console.html#_2014-02-26_20_17_58_346
2014-02-26T20:27:14  <jbooboo> mtreinish: it doesn't track openstack/requirements so it doesn't use the mirror
2014-02-26T20:27:41  <mtreinish> ahh ok that makes sense
2014-02-26T20:27:51  *** mspreitz has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-26T20:28:38  <mspreitz> Help, I made a procedural mistake.  I submitting a patch for review without making a branch for it.  How do I recover?
2014-02-26T20:29:59  <foobio> mspreitz: how do you want to recover? (what end state do you seek?)
2014-02-26T20:30:36  <mspreitz> First and foremost, no harm to anything else.  Second, eventually a patch submitted correctly.  The edits are few and easily reproduced.
2014-02-26T20:30:40  <openstackgerrit> A change was merged to openstack-infra/config: Fix success-pattern usage for openstack-manuals  https://review.openstack.org/76639
2014-02-26T20:31:09  <foobio> mspreitz: so, as long as the state of your work is captured in the review, you can always pull it back to your local system from gerrit
2014-02-26T20:31:21  <jbooboo> foobio, quantumfly, sdague: i don't think we have the space to hold zuul gearman server debug logs.  :(  i think 3 days will take like 97G.
2014-02-26T20:31:53  <jbooboo> so i think we're going to have to revert the logging config patch for now, then rework gear's logging so we can get useful information like that with less verbosity, then try again.
2014-02-26T20:31:59  <jbooboo> either that or attach a cinder volume for logs
2014-02-26T20:32:00  <mspreitz> Let me start with the first part.  Having submitted something on master, does that harm anything besides my submission?
2014-02-26T20:32:30  <foobio> mspreitz: nope, other than it probably has a blank topic in review.openstack.org, but that's not at all uncommon
2014-02-26T20:32:52  <foobio> mspreitz: in which case you can reset your local master branch to the same commit as the remote master with 'git reset --hard origin/master' and then you can retrieve your change into a local topic branch with 'git review -d NNNNN' (where NNNNN is the change number in gerrit)

2014-02-26T20:36:21  <mspreitz> BTW, I noticed one other harm to my submission, which is a bug fix: it is not listed in the bug.
2014-02-26T20:37:31  <foobio> mspreitz: right, you'll want to make sure at the end of your commit message you include a separate line like Closes-Bug: #XXXXXX

2014-02-26T20:38:22  <foobio> mspreitz: however, if that wasn't present on the initial patchset for your change, the bug doesn't get automatically updated until your change gets merged, so you may want to set the bug to in-progress, assign it to yourself, and leave a comment with the url to your proposed fix

2014-02-26T21:26:26  <sdague> but, if there is a different grenade race, we should revert the patch yuo think is an issue
2014-02-26T21:26:26  <foobio> seems like a safe enough change in case we decide to start writing to $BASE/new/grenade/localrc prior to that line eventually
2014-02-26T21:26:31  <sdague> then come back to it

2014-02-26T22:20:35  <foobio> we're closer--now it's at least trying to replicate, though we never puppeted the known_hosts for the gerrit2 user on review.o.o
2014-02-26T22:21:25  <jbooboo> foobio: interesting problem since each of the git servers has a different key
2014-02-26T22:21:48  <foobio> jbooboo: agreed. we'd presumably need to puppet each in advance of adding to replication configuration

2014-02-26T22:22:27  <foobio> however, i wonder whether gerrit caches the known_hosts file...
2014-02-26T22:22:31  <foobio> already did that part
2014-02-26T22:22:45  <quantumfly> exported resources can copy the key from gitXX to puppetdb when puppet runs on gitXX then when puppet runs on gerrit grab that value from puppetdb and put it in place
2014-02-26T22:22:52  <foobio> but it still seems to be logging Feb 26 22:21:23 git05 sshd[18001]: Received disconnect from 198.101.231.251: 3: com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: reject HostKey: git05.openstack.org
2014-02-26T22:22:56  <jbooboo> quantumfly: that actually sounds like the correct solution.
2014-02-26T22:22:58  <quantumfly> exported resources tend to be a bit ugly because you ahve to double tap puppet
2014-02-26T22:23:06  <quantumfly> and require puppetdb but we have one of those now
2014-02-26T22:23:10  <jbooboo> quantumfly: but are eventually consistent
2014-02-26T22:23:15  <quantumfly> jbooboo: correct
2014-02-26T22:24:09  <foobio> grr! https://review.openstack.org/Documentation/config-replication.html "Host keys for any destination SSH servers must appear in the user’s ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, and must be added in advance, before Gerrit starts.

2014-02-26T22:50:01  <jbooboo> Sukhdev: i don't.  if you are willing to do some serious debugging, you could to a tcpdump on your host and if that fails, compare it with a packet capture or session log from the firewall.  if you get that far and suspect that the problem is on the git.o.o side, we can schedule a time to do packet captures there as well.

2014-02-26T22:51:21  <jbooboo> Sukhdev: but honestly, we know that git.o.o is slightly overloaded at this point (we're almost done adding a new server), so it could just be bad luck.

2014-02-26T22:56:28  <jbooboo> mayu_: we think the git servers are overloaded, we're adding a new one now.  however, if you are behind a firewall or proxy, that could be the problem as well.

2014-02-26T23:43:45  <anteaya> can you post a new patchset to that change, please?
2014-02-26T23:43:55  <anteaya> let's see what your system is doing right now
2014-02-26T23:44:11  <mayu_> ok
2014-02-26T23:44:12  *** bhuvan___ has quit IRC
2014-02-26T23:44:46  <jbooboo> quantumfly: the stats run does a full iteration over all the jobs, so performance should improve as the queue goes down.  i'm kind of inclined to not apply any emergency fixes at the moment since i'm about to go afk for 2 days....
2014-02-26T23:45:07  <quantumfly> jbooboo: wfm
2014-02-26T23:45:07  <jbooboo> quantumfly: but i think we could switch geard to just using some internal counters so it doesn't have to do that
2014-02-26T23:45:10  *** bhuvan has quit IRC
2014-02-26T23:45:18  <quantumfly> it appeared a bit odd so I asked
2014-02-26T23:45:37  <anteaya> Sukhdev: you can try running .stack.sh again
2014-02-26T23:45:39  <quantumfly> but it iterating over the list each time makes sense about why it is slow
2014-02-26T23:45:43  <jbooboo> quantumfly: and if you decide you'd rather shut it off, removing the env vars from the defaults file and restarting should do the trick
2014-02-26T23:45:49  <quantumfly> jbooboo: ok
2014-02-26T23:45:55  <quantumfly> thank you for looking
2014-02-26T23:46:06  <jbooboo> "tcpdump port 8125 -A" on logstash is pretty cool, btw.  :)
2014-02-26T23:46:18  * quantumfly tries that
2014-02-26T23:47:08  <quantumfly> oh neat you can watch the waiting metric go crazy
2014-02-26T23:47:15  <dtroyer> quantumfly: I just left a response to your question in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/74910/, if you're happy it can go in.

2014-02-26T23:48:37  <quantumfly> dtroyer: and responded I think I can live with it as is aftr you point that out
2014-02-26T23:49:02  *** bhuvan__ has quit IRC
2014-02-26T23:49:02  *** bhuvan_ has quit IRC
2014-02-26T23:50:27  <dtroyer> cool, thanks
2014-02-26T23:51:12  <jbooboo> quantumfly: ?
2014-02-26T23:51:24  <jbooboo> quantumfly: devstack does fetches in the gate?
2014-02-26T23:51:30  <jbooboo> quantumfly: it shouldn't do _any_ git operations
2014-02-26T23:51:38  *** cadenzajon has quit IRC
2014-02-26T23:51:49  <quantumfly> jbooboo: I think at least one of those fetches was outside of the erroronclone condition
2014-02-26T23:51:56  <quantumfly> I didn't look at it too long /em looks again
2014-02-26T23:52:10  <dtroyer> one is outside, but inside RECLONE=True
2014-02-26T23:52:33  <quantumfly> ah
2014-02-26T23:52:40  <quantumfly> ok then no fetches in the gate
2014-02-26T23:52:42  *** dolphm is now known as dolphm_503
2014-02-26T23:53:05  <foobio> jbooboo: quantumfly: i think i agree that we're the ones ddosing ourselves... over 50% of the entries in the haproxy.log are from rackspace's ipv6 assignment
2014-02-26T23:53:14  <foobio> for the past hour

2014-02-26T23:55:18  *** mrodden has quit IRC
2014-02-26T23:55:28  <krtaylor> sdague, I am looking into it, I agree it would be much nicer, it may be possible if I dig deeper
2014-02-26T23:55:30  <mayu__> anteaya:it is the new patch that submitted right now.
2014-02-26T23:55:39  <anteaya> mayu__: okay so lets look at the comments your system leaves on that patch
2014-02-26T23:55:56  <anteaya> first of all it comments, that is a big thing to notice, well done
2014-02-26T23:56:00  *** lcheng__ has quit IRC
2014-02-26T23:56:04  <foobio> quantumfly: jbooboo: another 25% is from hp's class-a ipv4 assignment (and i'm willing to bet most of the remaining 25% are from other smaller hp allocations)
2014-02-26T23:56:06  <anteaya> that is the hard part
2014-02-26T23:56:24  <anteaya> mayu__: now you have to fine tune it so that it comments only when you want it to
2014-02-26T23:56:38  <anteaya> and the comments contain useful information
2014-02-26T23:56:50  <mayu__> ok
2014-02-26T23:57:05  <anteaya> mayu__: so it leaves this comment Starting check jobs. http://10.250.201.20/zuul/status
2014-02-26T23:57:11  <quantumfly> foobio: ya
2014-02-26T23:57:17  <anteaya> you need to ensure it does not leave that comment, mayu__
2014-02-26T23:57:32  <anteaya> mayu__: yours is one of about 40 ci systems
2014-02-26T23:57:33  *** e0ne has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-26T23:57:35  <foobio> jbooboo: quantumfly: though it's worth pointing out that i'm only analyzing the number of requests, so it's entirely possible that these are tiny fetches and someone else is doing whopping large reclones over and over which account for far fewer actual calls but much more system load
2014-02-26T23:57:44  *** nati_uen_ has quit IRC
2014-02-26T23:57:47  *** nati_ueno has quit IRC
2014-02-26T23:57:59  <quantumfly> foobio: good point
2014-02-26T23:58:06  <anteaya> mayu__: and if all 40 ci systems left that message when they are starting jobs, that is just a log of noise
2014-02-26T23:58:17  *** bhuvan has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-26T23:58:18  *** bhuvan___ has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-26T23:58:19  <quantumfly> foobio: there is an haproxy top thing we might want to look into using
2014-02-26T23:58:22  *** nati_ueno has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-26T23:58:26  <quantumfly> foobio: but I am pretty sure it isn't packaged anywhere
2014-02-26T23:58:26  <anteaya> mayu__: the only system that can leave the starting jobs message is our system, jenkins
2014-02-26T23:58:31  <quantumfly> which is why I ginored it in the past
2014-02-26T23:58:49  <anteaya> mayu__: does that make sense?
2014-02-26T23:59:02  <mayu__> not clear
2014-02-26T23:59:09  <foobio> quantumfly: hatop?
2014-02-26T23:59:11  *** bhuvan__ has quit IRC

2014-02-26T23:59:24  *** sarob has quit IRC
2014-02-26T23:59:35  <quantumfly> foobio: yeah
2014-02-26T23:59:37  <anteaya> mayu__: your system leaves a comment on the patch to say it is starting jobs
2014-02-26T23:59:47  <anteaya> mayu__: you need to ensure it does not leave that message
