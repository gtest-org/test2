2014-02-27T00:01:17  <mayu__> how to do that
2014-02-27T00:01:20  <anteaya> mayu__: take a look at this patch: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/66866/
2014-02-27T00:01:32  <anteaya> do you see how many ci systems are adding comments to this patch?
2014-02-27T00:01:59  <anteaya> at least 7 right now

2014-02-27T00:13:38  <anteaya> Sukhdev: glad you found the solution

2014-02-27T00:14:57  <mayu__> anteaya: once
2014-02-27T00:15:02  <anteaya> mayu__: great
2014-02-27T00:15:07  <anteaya> mayu__: you have to do the same

2014-02-27T00:16:36  <anteaya> mayu__: then the next thing you have to do is work on the content for the comment that you do leave

2014-02-27T00:16:58  <anteaya> mayu__: and has a link to the logs for the test run
2014-02-27T00:17:08  <foobio> 76714 works. approving
2014-02-27T00:17:11  <mayu__> ok

2014-02-27T00:17:32  <anteaya> mayu__: they all should have a link that lets you view the logs
2014-02-27T00:17:47  <mayu__> yes
2014-02-27T00:17:53  <anteaya> mayu__: your logs should be plain text, not html or pdf or anything else
2014-02-27T00:18:07  <mayu__> ok
2014-02-27T00:18:14  <anteaya> mayu__: do you see how jenkins leaves links to logs when jenkins comments?

2014-02-27T00:19:45  <anteaya> mayu__: in order to do anything else we need to be able to see your test logs
2014-02-27T00:19:53  <anteaya> mayu__: without them we can't go further

2014-02-27T00:33:51  <quantumfly> jbooboo: maybe we should reconsider varnishing git stuff
2014-02-27T00:34:13  <quantumfly> the git load balancing trouble reminded me that was a thing briefly talked about at LCA
2014-02-27T00:35:37  <foobio> quantumfly: just --noop tested it (on logstash.o.o) and the only delta from what we fixed locally is that it also tweaks the apache vhost to redirect teh query endpoint from elasticsearch.o.o to now use elasticsearch01.o.o instead
2014-02-27T00:35:54  <foobio> presumably that's safe
2014-02-27T00:36:04  <foobio> es01 is now the cluster master too

2014-02-27T12:22:20  <flaper87> sdague: indeed, it's unfortunate that I don't have a nice way to test it locally, or is there?

2014-02-27T12:39:53  *** luqas has quit IRC
2014-02-27T12:39:57  <sdague> mostly I wondered why it doesn't presume allocating a compute, like trove
2014-02-27T12:40:39  *** CaptTofu has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-27T12:40:52  <sdague> I would have expected that it would call back to nova to provision the queue compute, then layer the service stack on top
2014-02-27T12:42:41  <flaper87> sdague: mmh, it doesn't need to do that. I mean, I think (just guessing here) that trove does that because there's an agent running on each compute node
2014-02-27T12:43:05  <flaper87> in Marconi we don't have agent, just marconi-server nodes that can live pretty much anywhere
2014-02-27T12:44:38  *** weshay has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-27T12:45:26  <sdague> ok, so what happens when your marconi install hits capacity?
2014-02-27T12:46:41  <sdague> I guess I just find it odd that a service at this level does leverage nova to be inherently elastic. I do understand that you don't have to do it that way, but it still seems a little odd to me.
2014-02-27T12:46:44  <flaper87> you add more `marconi-server` nodes (assuming you hit an API capacity limit and not a backend capacity limit)
2014-02-27T12:47:02  <sdague> s/does/does not/
2014-02-27T12:48:31  <flaper87> sdague: oh well, I see what you mean. In terms of interoperability with other openstack services, that could definitely be something interesting to do. It doesn't have to be necessarily like that but it can be done.
2014-02-27T12:48:43  <flaper87> sdague: that's a good thought, btw! thanks for sharing.
2014-02-27T12:49:09  <sdague> cool, well thanks for letting me bounce it off someone
2014-02-27T12:49:21  <flaper87> malini has been fixing our devstack support so, I guess I could talk to her and see if she can extend it to do something similar to trove
2014-02-27T12:49:47  *** heyongli has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-27T12:49:55  <sdague> yeh, it would be interesting. Especially as we grow services, I've been thinking a lot about how they work together instead of work cross purposes
2014-02-27T12:51:13  <sdague> especially when we look at the pain of maintaining certain applications in openstack infra that aren't cloud aware, like jenkins

2014-02-27T12:53:52  <flaper87> sdague: I agree. We've brainstormed about some load-tests for Marconi that involve running it in nova compute nodes
2014-02-27T12:54:12  <flaper87> and scaling it by adding more nodes of both services (nova and marconi)
2014-02-27T12:54:28  <flaper87> we're not there yet but that will require extending what we're doing right now in devstack
2014-02-27T12:56:03  <sdague> flaper87: well shouldn't it be more baked into marconi, like on an admin API. So that marconi could provision itself out?
2014-02-27T12:56:06  <flaper87> sdague: I've been thinking about how marconi would live along with other openstack services. I mean, whether it can be deployed along with other services in the same node, what services should definitely not be installed along with marconi, etc
2014-02-27T12:56:45  <sdague> POC In devstack would be fine as well, but I definitely think some inherent understanding of living in a cloud would be good
2014-02-27T12:57:05  <flaper87> sdague: it could be, yes. However, I'm also thinking that that's something I would prefer heat doing. I'm not quite sure what the best way to do that is as of now.
2014-02-27T12:57:16  <sdague> sure, heat's a fair option as well
2014-02-27T12:57:26  <flaper87> sdague: there's already a blueprint for Heat
2014-02-27T12:57:33  <flaper87> and someone was working on that
2014-02-27T12:57:45  <sdague> savana today has direct nova calls, but is building a heat provisioner
2014-02-27T12:57:51  <sdague> and that makes sense to me

2014-02-27T13:30:29  <sdague> just for everyone in here to be aware - making devstack -o errexit by default (through the gate in the next hour) is probably going to cause a bunch of 3rd party folks systems to break, because their code for their plugins is terrible

2014-02-27T14:05:55  <foobio> i've taken the second-to-last old (non-performance 30g) node out of the cluster, so we're almost entirely rebalanced onto the new performance/pvhvm 60g nodes

2014-02-27T14:12:34  <sdague> I think we went over this last week, right?
2014-02-27T14:12:41  <sdague> about doing multinode in the gate
2014-02-27T14:12:57  <matrohon> sdague : when you say tah devstack already support multinode, you mean with several devstack
2014-02-27T14:13:03  <sdague> correct
2014-02-27T14:13:13  <matrohon> sdague : ok
2014-02-27T14:13:37  <jgallard> do you think there is no interesting usage for devstack to lunch lxc for dev ?
2014-02-27T14:13:49  <jgallard> not for the gate, but for end-developers ?
2014-02-27T14:14:06  <sdague> I think it's a new complexity that has a lot of implications
2014-02-27T14:14:21  <sdague> because everything that works in devstack today will have to work in that model as well
2014-02-27T14:14:59  <foobio> the concern i have with adding support for something like that to devstack is that we have no means to test whether it works... similar implications as for nova/cinder/neutron device drivers
2014-02-27T14:15:09  <sdague> 100% agreed

2014-02-27T14:16:36  <sdague> if it's in the devstack tree, it's part of devstack
2014-02-27T14:17:18  <jgallard> ok, of course
2014-02-27T14:17:24  <foobio> and teh problem with adding out-of-tree plugins is that devstack doesn't really have a stable api, so again too fragile of an interface
2014-02-27T14:18:06  <sdague> the end game here is really multinode testing, right?
2014-02-27T14:18:19  <jgallard> the idea was to add a mechanism that allow devstack to automatically runs devstack inside containers or more generically inside others VM/hardware etc
2014-02-27T14:18:20  <sdague> so why don't we just go tackle that

2014-02-27T14:19:38  <sdague> "if it's not tested it's broken"

2014-02-27T14:20:46  *** yamahata has quit IRC
2014-02-27T14:20:53  <jgallard> so, no interesting way to work in that area?
2014-02-27T14:21:00  <foobio> from an upstream perspective, jenkins is the biggest challenge for multi-node testing currently, but that doesn't mean other organizations who are using non-jenkins infrastructure without similar challenges couldn't implement a makeshift solution to create and associate multiple devstacks today... we'd just really appreciate if the development effort were focused more on the things we need to be able
2014-02-27T14:21:02  <foobio> to get there with upstream testing since it benefits a lot more people
2014-02-27T14:21:16  *** yamahata has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-27T14:21:57  <jgallard> ok
2014-02-27T14:22:50  <jgallard> sdague, foobio , thanks a lot for your time and all yours explanations, we will continue to think about that :-)
2014-02-27T14:22:56  <sdague> no prob
2014-02-27T14:23:14  <foobio> more devs helping us improve and test zuul and nodepool, mean more devs familiar with those codebases and more of the short-term needs met sooner so we can move on to what is needed to be able to ad-hoc associate multiple nodes for a single job

2014-02-27T14:23:54  *** thuc has quit IRC
2014-02-27T14:24:43  <sdague> yeh, there is a real path forward in doing multi node testing in the gate. And if you want to do multi node locally, this is working quite well for me - https://github.com/sdague/devstack-vagrant (improvements welcomed)
2014-02-27T14:25:21  *** CaptTofu has quit IRC
2014-02-27T14:25:53  <foobio> and the path forward is longer or shorter depending on how many people are focused on helping us down it, rather than going off in a corner and building something temporary which will eventually obsolete anyway
2014-02-27T14:26:15  <jgallard> ( sdague , thanks for the link)

2014-02-27T14:26:55  <matrohon> foobio sdague : thanks! we really would like to help you on this path, but we have to convince are managers that we have to spend time on it :)
2014-02-27T14:26:59  <jgallard> ok, I think I got your points
2014-02-27T14:27:17  <jgallard> we have to think about all of that now :-)
2014-02-27T14:27:21  <foobio> and i know it's a somewhat counter-intuitive answer that the fastest way to get multi-node testing in the upstream gate is not to work on multi-node testing directly, but to help improve the tools which are going to allow us to implement multi-node testing
2014-02-27T14:27:32  <sdague> matrohon: ok. well tell them the lxc approach won't get approved :)
2014-02-27T14:27:36  <sdague> that should help
2014-02-27T14:28:09  <jgallard> sdague, :-)
2014-02-27T14:28:18  <matrohon> sdague : of course :)  beut it was more about proposing the multi-node environnement that we are using in our lab
2014-02-27T14:29:29  <matrohon> sdague : since this is really usefull for us, we though that it could be a way to implement multi-node in the gate

2014-02-27T14:30:35  <matrohon> and mainly on improving tunneling
2014-02-27T14:30:38  <sdague> right, and that's the challenge, we need a multinode that works for everything
2014-02-27T14:30:51  <sdague> otherwise it's a weird one off

2014-02-27T14:32:42  <matrohon> sdague : of course. there is also, "evacuate" which should be more tested
2014-02-27T14:32:46  <sdague> matrohon: the basic idea was to just get zuul to allocate 2 nodes in the cloud and build an L2 between them
2014-02-27T14:33:00  <sdague> openvpn is one way to do that
2014-02-27T14:33:04  <foobio> testing tunnels will be fun, because we already need layer-2 tunnels to connect ethernet between the nodes...
2014-02-27T14:33:13  <foobio> so you'll be doing nested tunnels
2014-02-27T14:33:27  <sdague> sure, but that's fine, turtles all the way down
2014-02-27T14:33:48  <foobio> sdague: we could do l2 over gre/null-enc ipsec too if we wanted
2014-02-27T14:34:08  <foobio> it's just a question of what's easiest to get running i think
2014-02-27T14:34:31  <sdague> sure, I suggested openvpn l2 just because I've done it
2014-02-27T14:34:43  <matrohon> the other alternative is tripleo in the gate?
2014-02-27T14:34:47  <sdague> and it has the advantage of being host controlable
2014-02-27T14:34:55  <foobio> in a way which won't conflict with or get stepped on by the openstack components being tested (neutron, i'm talking about you again)
2014-02-27T14:35:05  <sdague> matrohon: well tripleo is a ways off for getting in the gate

2014-02-27T14:36:07  <foobio> ahh, yep looks like maybe they got it running again in the last hour or two
2014-02-27T14:36:08  *** yamahata has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-27T14:36:25  <foobio> maybe they need some cleanup on the nodepool side to open up more capacity for them
2014-02-27T14:36:49  <sdague> maybe, it looks like they really are only doing 1 job at a time and it could be for a reason
2014-02-27T14:36:58  <sdague> at this point I'd let them come forward

2014-02-27T15:47:28  <tristanC> oh and, does "reverify" really works ? isn't it "recheck" ?
2014-02-27T15:47:44  <anteaya> tristanC: reverify works if you use a bug number
2014-02-27T15:47:52  * rohitk looking..
2014-02-27T15:48:02  <anteaya> and only if it is used on the patchset that was approved
2014-02-27T15:48:11  <anteaya> tristanC: the other option is reapproval
2014-02-27T15:48:43  <anteaya> tristanC: so if you hit a bug and you have no bug number, ask around and be prepared to create a bug report
2014-02-27T15:48:59  <anteaya> tristanC: if you need some help groking the logs to find the error, do ask

2014-02-27T17:30:57  <foobio> SergeyLukjanov: sure, i don't see why not. we have several jobs which build jarfiles already i think (for gerrit as an example) so you might draw some from that. also pay attention to the recent docs job changes to call maven directly using a jenkins freestyle job--would be best not to add new jobs using jenkins' internal maven support

2014-02-27T18:09:59  <quantumfly> dhellmann: morning
2014-02-27T18:10:00  <foobio> perfect. tried ssh'ing into them and hadn't seen them in nova list for rax-dfw
2014-02-27T18:10:36  <dhellmann> I'm looking into adding gate tests for some of the new oslo libs, and I feel like I'm doing a lot of copying and pasting. I don't see a template that means "run the usual gate jobs" -- is that something you've discussed adding and just not gotten to?
2014-02-27T18:11:12  <dhellmann> I could take a stab at adding a template, but if there's a reason not to then I'll just keep pasting :-)
2014-02-27T18:11:29  <jog0> Any ETA for when gantt will be moved out of openstack and into stackforge

2014-02-27T18:14:11  <jog0> see the infra ML thread
2014-02-27T18:14:13  <quantumfly> does my opinion count?
2014-02-27T18:14:20  <quantumfly> gantt is an openstack project
2014-02-27T18:14:26  <jog0> quantumfly: why not
2014-02-27T18:14:37  <jog0> your opinion always counts to me ;)
2014-02-27T18:14:40  <quantumfly> because we are just going to have to move it in 6 months

2014-02-27T18:15:02  <jog0> so the short of it is:
2014-02-27T18:15:24  <quantumfly> dhellmann: if we can come up with a good way to template that I think we should. Pretty sure we just haven't gotten to it
2014-02-27T18:15:36  <jog0> at the nova nova mid-cycle we realized that there is significant work to be done to rework the API that the scheduler uses to talk to the rest of nova before pulling it out
2014-02-27T18:15:59  <jog0> furthermore the current code base is a throw away
2014-02-27T18:16:12  <dhellmann> quantumfly: ok, I'll take a start then, and see where it goes

2014-02-27T18:18:56  <jog0> nova doesn't want to maintain that repo
2014-02-27T18:19:02  <quantumfly> nova doesn't have to
2014-02-27T18:19:19  <jog0> then how does it get to live in openstack?
2014-02-27T18:19:37  <quantumfly> because it is openstack code
2014-02-27T18:19:42  <jog0> no its not
2014-02-27T18:19:43  <quantumfly> to do a central openstack service
2014-02-27T18:19:47  <jog0> it wants to be
2014-02-27T18:19:55  <jog0> but its broken beyond all hell
2014-02-27T18:20:03  <jog0> it design  etc
2014-02-27T18:20:11  <quantumfly> being part of openstack has no requirement on having nova review your code
2014-02-27T18:20:48  <jog0> so this skipped stackforge because nova program started it, now nova program doesn't want it
2014-02-27T18:20:59  <jog0> so I assumed it should just go back to stackforge

2014-02-27T18:48:16  <foobio> but also official in this regard is fuzzy... we have incubated projects in the openstack repository namespace too... does that make them official? do we need to do something for the eventual project which aborts the incubation process?

2014-02-27T19:37:55  <ArxCruz> perhaps was a problem with git03 too ?
2014-02-27T19:38:10  <ArxCruz> when you fix the cookbook, it fix the nova too
2014-02-27T19:38:12  <ArxCruz> dunno
2014-02-27T19:38:30  <foobio> that's strange
2014-02-27T19:39:21  <foobio> should have been entirely unrelated. the issue on git03 was that with puppet agent being stuck, any new projects added after feb 19 would not have gotten copies of their repositories created on it

2014-02-27T20:17:16  <quantumfly> foobio: pretty sure it has done that so that the recovered data doesn't need to be merged post recovery
2014-02-27T20:17:48  <foobio> quantumfly: would that explain the slow-down in indexing over the past couple days too?

2014-02-27T21:23:45  <jog0> so we can get partial-ncpu working
2014-02-27T21:24:00  <jog0> (because I made silly mistakes the first time around)
2014-02-27T21:24:06  <sdague> +A

2014-02-27T21:24:23  <jog0> sdague: thanks
2014-02-27T21:24:35  <jog0> wanted to get it in around now so I can babysit it a little if needed
2014-02-27T21:24:37  <quantumfly> SergeyLukjanov: zaro ${foo} works and is preferred iirc
2014-02-27T21:24:44  <quantumfly> because it delimits the variable
2014-02-27T21:25:08  <SergeyLukjanov> quantumfly, ok, it was just a question to clarify;)
2014-02-27T21:25:36  <quantumfly> SergeyLukjanov: yup np
2014-02-27T21:25:38  <sdague> so next time we are openning up the zuul code on the sliding window
2014-02-27T21:25:51  <sdague> it would be nice to have the window being the executing jobs
2014-02-27T21:26:17  <sdague> we've got another stall window now, with 19 changes complete and ready to merge, and head change running behind
2014-02-27T21:26:43  <quantumfly> sdague: that is a lot more complicated
2014-02-27T21:26:47  <foobio> sdague: yeah, and it's failing on grenade
2014-02-27T21:26:49  <sdague> quantumfly: yeh, I realize
2014-02-27T21:26:55  <SergeyLukjanov> quantumfly, heh - https://github.com/openstack-infra/config/blob/master/modules/openstack_project/files/jenkins_job_builder/config/maven-plugin-jobs.yaml#L58
2014-02-27T21:26:56  <quantumfly> because change at head could cause everything behind it to fail
2014-02-27T21:27:02  <sdague> oh, were going to reset?
2014-02-27T21:27:03  <sdague> boo
2014-02-27T21:27:06  <foobio> i think whatever has happened to die inside the grenade change is causing it to run longer
2014-02-27T21:27:15  <foobio> er, grenade job
2014-02-27T21:27:17  <SergeyLukjanov> quantumfly, zaro, the ${{..}} is already used in other place - https://github.com/openstack-infra/config/blob/master/modules/openstack_project/files/jenkins_job_builder/config/maven-plugin-jobs.yaml#L58
2014-02-27T21:27:45  <openstackgerrit> A change was merged to openstack-infra/config: fix scp reference to variable  https://review.openstack.org/76730
2014-02-27T21:27:48  <quantumfly> SergeyLukjanov: the difference is in a job template you need ${{}} to escape the {}s to be a single {}
2014-02-27T21:27:55  <foobio> also the requirements integration job always runs long, so lately when there's something stalling the head of the gate it seems to be a requirements/pbr/pypi-mirror change
2014-02-27T21:27:58  <quantumfly> SergeyLukjanov: in normal jobs there is no escaping so you give it a literla {}
2014-02-27T21:28:16  <quantumfly> sdague: so you don't erally know if a fialing job deserves a window change
2014-02-27T21:28:21  <SergeyLukjanov> quantumfly, got it
2014-02-27T21:28:24  <quantumfly> sdague: but you do know a failing change does

2014-02-27T21:29:00  *** sandywalsh has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-27T21:29:09  <sdague> quantumfly: well the reason for the window was to handle the stampede problem
2014-02-27T21:29:24  <sdague> so if the window was executing jobs, if we reset, the window is just smaller
2014-02-27T21:29:33  <quantumfly> right, and it may unfairly handle that if we let a job at the end of the window reduce the window
2014-02-27T21:29:48  <sdague> quantumfly: sure
2014-02-27T21:30:06  <sdague> but even with our 20 minimum
2014-02-27T21:30:19  <sdague> this means we'd have executed 38 deep
2014-02-27T21:30:27  <sdague> and a reset, we'd just start the top 20 again
2014-02-27T21:30:44  <sdague> it's about throughput maximization without stampeding
2014-02-27T21:31:05  <foobio> in general it seems to be helping. high failure rates will still cause a pileup in the gate, but at least they no longer cause us to delay running other jobs because we're thrashing the pool of available workers
2014-02-27T21:31:08  <sdague> this is all swift fail
2014-02-27T21:31:47  *** mrodden has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-27T21:31:48  <sdague> foobio: I don't suppose there is any way to kick the job to capture the logs so far and have it end?
2014-02-27T21:31:57  <sdague> because otherwise this is going to the timeout
2014-02-27T21:32:03  <quantumfly> right but we also knew this would be overconservative

2014-02-27T21:32:59  <quantumfly> sdague: honestly I think the triggering off of changes behavior is correct
2014-02-27T21:33:18  <foobio> sdague: i can hold the node it's running on and get someone a login to view the state of the machine and existing logs on it, then abort the running job in jenkins

2014-02-27T21:35:14  <sdague> quantumfly: well we also have issues where zuul restarts jobs it knows failed for bad reasons, and we get the same pile up

2014-02-27T21:36:08  <quantumfly> sdague: ya :( silly jenkins. One possible way to mitigate that would be to have zuul reenqueue with high priority rather than default priority
2014-02-27T21:36:14  <sdague> yep
2014-02-27T21:36:19  <foobio> i've aborted https://jenkins02.openstack.org/job/gate-grenade-dsvm/6333/

2014-02-27T21:37:27  *** bhuvan_ has quit IRC
2014-02-27T21:37:30  <sdague> I expect we've got this in logstash somewhere, I'll just figure out what to do to find existing results
2014-02-27T21:37:48  <sdague> as I've seen grenade timing out recently, and my guess is they are the same bug
2014-02-27T21:38:32  <sdague> foobio: let me know when the key is on

2014-02-27T21:56:31  <foobio> yeah, stack user has a python process with 8080/tcp listening, and tempest user has several python processes connecting to it according to lsof

2014-02-27T21:56:56  <sdague> in the ps
2014-02-27T21:57:01  <jog0> not sure what target_services is so dont' think so

2014-02-27T22:23:20  <dims> wiki here - https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GSoC2014 and we are also on #openstack-gsoc

2014-02-27T22:24:03  <quantumfly> dims so if I wanted to push that idea, add it to the list and someone as a mentor?

2014-02-27T22:24:44  <dims> quantumfly, even idea is enough if we can't muster up a mentor right away
2014-02-27T22:25:14  <quantumfly> dims: good to know. hopefully foobio doesn't say I am crazywhen he gets back
2014-02-27T22:26:02  <dims> :)
2014-02-27T22:26:44  <quantumfly> jhesketh_: thoughts? I think you have done the most work in that area and don't want to step on toes

2014-02-27T22:34:02  <sdague> so check in on elastic search - I see from status page it seems to be making forward progress, though slowly
2014-02-27T22:34:21  <sdague> do we think we're going to get recovery soon? or are we not going to have it for i3?
2014-02-27T22:34:48  *** Ryan_Lane1 has joined #openstack-infra
2014-02-27T22:36:08  <quantumfly> sdague: I think it should recover overnight assuming the workers don't fall over
2014-02-27T22:36:23  <quantumfly> I believe workers falling over was related to memory presuure and shard recovery
2014-02-27T22:36:29  <quantumfly> which should be sorted now
2014-02-27T22:36:34  <quantumfly> we will know much more tomorrow

2014-02-27T22:37:27  <quantumfly> don't forget that overnight the test rate is much lower
2014-02-27T22:37:37  <quantumfly> I expect the derivative to change based on hour

2014-02-27T22:42:08  <sdague> there were 18 patches, all tests run fine
2014-02-27T22:42:17  <sdague> 2 patches out for merge conflicts

2014-02-27T22:42:36  <quantumfly> when we go to do the actual merge
2014-02-27T22:42:37  <sdague> then one seemed to merge, and the whole rest reset
2014-02-27T22:42:40  <sdague> gah
2014-02-27T22:42:44  <sdague> that's annoying
2014-02-27T22:43:02  <sdague> does that register an event we can track?

2014-02-27T22:43:37  <sdague> can we use jgit earlier?

2014-02-27T22:45:22  <jhesketh_> non-jenkins workers as a mentorship project?
2014-02-27T22:45:22  <quantumfly> jhesketh_: GSoC project idea for replacing jenkins with non jenkins gearman workers. EG extend turbo hipster if that is in scope or write something from scratch if not in scope
2014-02-27T22:45:26  <quantumfly> jhesketh_: yup
2014-02-27T22:45:42  <sdague> hey, there we go, that could be a GSoC project - zuul jgit merger
2014-02-27T22:45:44  <sdague> :)
2014-02-27T22:45:59  <jhesketh_> quantumfly: I'm all for more help! :-)
2014-02-27T22:46:16  <jhesketh_> I was actually trying to think if I could help out with the GSoC, I'd be happy to help mentor somebody with that
2014-02-27T22:46:50  <jhesketh_> I'm also happy for somebody else to as well

2014-02-27T22:47:41  <jhesketh_> turbo-hipster does have an arbitrary shell runner, so the main part is getting TH to support JJB
2014-02-27T22:47:51  <jhesketh_> quantumfly: sure

2014-02-27T22:52:21  <dims> foobio, i just picked the list of folks who were on the wiki page. i bet we have a lot more folks signing tags, do we have a place to find the list of all the key ids?

2014-02-27T22:56:38  <foobio> the first step was to start getting some keysigning going among people involved in the release process though, which we started well enough in hong kong and i expect to catch up with a lot more of them in atlanta

2014-02-27T23:45:39  <foobio> quantumfly: jhesketh__: lgtm
2014-02-27T23:45:39  <rdwrer> Which is horse shit, because the creds I'm using are the global admin account
2014-02-27T23:45:58  <rdwrer> I assume something else is going wrong, just not sure what
2014-02-27T23:46:15  <quantumfly> rdwrer: are you using an api key?
2014-02-27T23:46:29  <rdwrer> quantumfly: Yeah

2014-02-27T23:47:14  <quantumfly> I would double check the username and key match.
2014-02-27T23:47:30  <rdwrer> They definitely do

2014-02-27T23:48:25  <mgagne> rdwrer: make sure the API token is used, not the account password
2014-02-27T23:48:31  <rdwrer> It is
2014-02-27T23:48:43  <rdwrer> Oh, but...the config file has "password"
2014-02-27T23:49:06  <mgagne> rdwrer: password is the entry to use for the API token
2014-02-27T23:49:09  <rdwrer> Hm, that seems to...yeah
2014-02-27T23:49:41  <mgagne> rdwrer: [jenkins] is the section name, user is the username, password is the API token and url is the base URL to your jenkins server.
2014-02-27T23:49:48  <rdwrer> We saw this before, myself and hashar - I could modify existing jobs, just not create new ones
2014-02-27T23:49:58  <rdwrer> mgagne: All that is working fine
2014-02-27T23:50:42  <mgagne> rdwrer: is your user authorized to create new job? Make sure your have proper permissions in "Configure Global Security" section
2014-02-27T23:51:04  <foobio> though it seems odd that the global admin account might lack that permission
2014-02-27T23:51:12  <rdwrer> Will look
2014-02-27T23:51:20  <rdwrer> foobio: It's a bot that we use to create and manage jobs
2014-02-27T23:51:26  <foobio> ahh
2014-02-27T23:51:28  <mgagne> foobio: not sure if the actual admin account is used by rdwrer or not
2014-02-27T23:51:55  <foobio> earlier rdwrer said "the creds I'm using are the global admin account"
2014-02-27T23:52:13  * mgagne should pay more attention
2014-02-27T23:52:36  * foobio should pay people to pay attention for him. much less effort
2014-02-27T23:52:53  <rdwrer> I'll try something new
2014-02-27T23:53:00  <rdwrer> I hadn't seen the global security thing before
2014-02-27T23:53:10  <rdwrer> I'll try using my account and making sure it has the right permissions
