2014-05-03T00:03:55  <dstufft> mordred: wat
2014-05-03T00:04:11  <dstufft> mordred: how are feature branches the opposite of CI
2014-05-03T00:04:22  <dstufft> that's like saying Trucks are the opposite of Apples :V
2014-05-03T00:04:59  <mordred> dstufft: continuous integration is the process of continuously integrating work

2014-05-03T00:05:14  <dstufft> mordred: sure, when it's ready to be integrated
2014-05-03T00:05:18  <mordred> dstufft: feature branches are a technique for doing parallel work efforts and then integrating later

2014-05-03T00:05:52  <mordred> which typically comes at a higher cost due to the larger amount of work needed to be done at each integration window
2014-05-03T00:06:17  <dstufft> not using feature branches means you're always working on mainline, which means you end up with stuff just sitting uncommitted in your current directory because it's not ready to be integrated yet
2014-05-03T00:06:57  <mordred> or you do your work in smaller chunks so that it can be integrated sooner

2014-05-03T00:11:59  <mordred> mind you - I'm not saying that feature branches may not be a good idea depending on the team size and the project- but quite literally CI was developed in the first place to deal with the problem of merge hell that arose from feature branches
2014-05-03T00:13:19  <dstufft> I'm generally for small feature branches so that you can integrate it sooner sure, but going by that defintion it seems to mean you can't use any branches at all
2014-05-03T00:13:55  <mordred> I think there is a difference between long-lived shared feature branches
2014-05-03T00:14:13  <mordred> and short-lived small feature branches
2014-05-03T00:14:21  <mordred> which are really just "branches"
2014-05-03T00:14:28  <mordred> I use those like crazy
2014-05-03T00:14:38  <openstackgerrit> John Griffith proposed a change to openstack-infra/config: Create cinder-specs git repo  https://review.openstack.org/91723

2014-05-03T00:15:26  <dstufft> mordred: going by this defintion of CI it seems like code reviews are impossible too
2014-05-03T00:15:47  <foobio> branches make sense when you're branching your development effort off in different directions... it's when you need to bring those branches back together again that things get ugly. trees don't often reintegrate branches in nature either ;)
2014-05-03T00:15:48  *** manishg has quit IRC
2014-05-03T00:16:44  <foobio> and yes, gerrit's code review model really is like having lots of little feature branches you reintegrate asap

2014-05-03T00:17:16  <mordred> dstufft: I'm not sure I agree - I think the underlying idea is that you don't want to go off and do multi-weeks of work without landing things
2014-05-03T00:17:24  <openstackgerrit> John Griffith proposed a change to openstack-infra/config: Create cinder-specs git repo  https://review.openstack.org/91723
2014-05-03T00:17:43  <mordred> whether you accomplish that with branches, patches or direct-commits to master is an impl detail
2014-05-03T00:18:03  <foobio> finding out as soon as possible that your work is in conflict with one of the hundreds of other developers on your project tends to be a time saver
2014-05-03T00:18:45  <dstufft> mordred: so I just read the martin fowler article, and going by his defintion of CI it's something I never ever want to use.
2014-05-03T00:19:02  *** manishg has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-03T00:19:58  <dstufft> I generally agree with the idea that you don't want to do multi weeks work of things without landing it, and that you should strive to make your feature branches as small as possible
2014-05-03T00:20:09  <mordred> dstufft: well, yeah - that's the crazy-pants theory guy
2014-05-03T00:20:19  <mordred> dstufft: I don't want to do that eiter :)
2014-05-03T00:20:33  <dstufft> Like I don't think his defintion of CI is useful in any way

2014-05-03T00:23:01  *** packet has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-03T00:23:10  <foobio> the more toned down suggestion there is that it's potentially safer, assuming you have *extensive* testing of the project, to develop code behind feature flags on mainline and continuously test that you're not breaking mainline in the process
2014-05-03T00:23:40  <foobio> and also have tests that enable your feature and exercise it
2014-05-03T00:24:01  *** manishg has quit IRC
2014-05-03T00:24:04  *** praneshp has quit IRC
2014-05-03T00:24:20  <foobio> and that way everyone's developing with your code in progress already landed, so the chances of divergence are significantly lessened
2014-05-03T00:24:23  *** manishg has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-03T00:25:38  <foobio> as opposed to having 50 feature branches, and just before release everyone wants to integrate them at the same time and discovers all sorts of reasons why they interact negatively
2014-05-03T00:25:48  <dstufft> sounds like a good way to end up with lots of churn on the mainline, unless people write software completely differently than I do
2014-05-03T00:27:08  <dstufft> trying to land 50 changes at once sounds like a receipe for pain no matter how you do it :)

2014-05-03T00:28:55  <dstufft> (I also think that shipping software with options that essentially say, break this software because the feature is half done is bad form)

2014-05-03T00:32:25  <foobio> and testing bob's, betty's and bill's features in progress simultaneously is a lot easier if it just means enabling several experimental options rather than trying to solve merge commits between all their individual feature branches
2014-05-03T00:32:47  <foobio> s/simultaneously/together/
2014-05-03T00:33:09  <dstufft> foobio: I think there's a difference between experimental (which implies the feature is in some sort of working state but maybe has some corner cases) and is always going to be broken because half the functionality isn't there yet
2014-05-03T00:34:17  <foobio> well, that goes back to not developing in huge chunks. land bits which work by themselves, even if they don't necessarily do much, and build up to the full feature
2014-05-03T00:34:25  <foobio> rather than landing broken code

2014-05-03T00:36:48  <foobio> more that you stub out or mock the parts you'll flesh out later, acting as no-ops and so on, rather than just leaving dangling breakage
2014-05-03T00:37:23  <dstufft> well that's half broken :) the end user don't care

2014-05-03T00:38:35  <foobio> i think it's a question of audience. if the end user wants bleeding-edge-pull-from-github-on-every-commit software, then those are the sorts of rough edges i thing would be expected
2014-05-03T00:38:50  <foobio> er, think
2014-05-03T00:39:33  *** manishg has quit IRC
2014-05-03T00:40:19  <foobio> you can always start a release branch and continue cherry-picking the remaining parts of in progress features (or disengaging/disabling them) before releasing to the other audience who expects the fully-baked experience
2014-05-03T00:40:46  <dstufft> Well in that case your mainline branch isn't actually always in a releaseable state, you just pretend it is because your tests happen to pass

2014-05-03T00:42:18  *** andreykurilin_ has quit IRC
2014-05-03T00:43:12  <foobio> yeah, i'm just saying i think that having your features out-of-tree and then dumping them into mainline just before release isn't necessarily "always releasable" either
2014-05-03T00:43:44  <foobio> of course mainline seems "still releasable" if you never add new commits to it until release time rolls around
2014-05-03T00:43:44  *** pcrews_ has quit IRC
2014-05-03T00:44:04  <dstufft> do people actually do that? Just hold open N feature branches until it's time to release
2014-05-03T00:44:14  <foobio> but then there wouldn't be any point in running from mainline anyway if it was no different from the last release

2014-05-03T00:44:30  <dstufft> Every place I've ever seen would open a feature branch, complete the feature, merge it in

2014-05-03T00:44:54  *** ArxCruz has quit IRC
2014-05-03T00:45:10  <dstufft> the feature branch might be open 10 minutes, or 10 days, wahtever it takes to complete the feature
2014-05-03T00:45:28  *** manishg has quit IRC
2014-05-03T00:45:43  <dstufft> so things land in a staggered fashion
2014-05-03T00:45:48  *** aconrad has quit IRC
2014-05-03T00:46:48  <foobio> it's not so much the idea that mainline is always releasable, but rather that every commit on mainline is a release, and releasing continuously on a complex project tends to require either a compromise of developers not working within one another's contexts, or landing partial features which are disabled by default and marked as being in progress
2014-05-03T00:46:54  *** packet has quit IRC
2014-05-03T00:47:21  <foobio> at least those are the two approaches i've seen with any regularity
2014-05-03T00:48:16  <foobio> also, i am more a fan of good old-fashioned releases, but i gather that ci is fashionable in this fast-paced new devops utopia where the users are often also the developers
2014-05-03T00:48:45  <dstufft> sure i've seen both approaches too, but the "partial features" approach i've seen don't fall under martin fowler's defintion of CI either, because they were done in a branch, might have taken a few days to write, and were reviewed before they were integrated
2014-05-03T00:49:08  *** manishg has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-03T00:49:23  <dstufft> his CI seems to require just everyone commiting straight to master
2014-05-03T00:50:03  <dstufft> (I'm not sure how you'd do his CI on an OSS project at all TBH)
2014-05-03T00:50:40  <foobio> yeah, i think the idea of "topic branches" falls in between chaos and feature branches. i would consider the way we handle code review of one or a small stack of commits in gerrit to be topical rather than feature-oriented
2014-05-03T00:52:12  <foobio> consider the lkml... i'm not sure i'd actually call an e-mail thread a "branch" in the revision control sense, but it's basically the same idea
2014-05-03T00:52:26  <dstufft> foobio: would you approve a changeset that had half a feature with some guards around the new feature and a promise to submit a second patch later?
2014-05-03T00:52:48  <foobio> with a well-written and approved design to back it up, yeah
2014-05-03T00:53:07  <dstufft> so what do you do if the second patch never comes
2014-05-03T00:53:18  *** manishg has quit IRC
2014-05-03T00:53:58  <foobio> that's technical debt, but in all likelihood no worse than the technical debt of resolving the merge conflicts if it had been landed as one giant series in parallel with several others which tried to touch the same bits of the repository
2014-05-03T00:54:08  *** manishg has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-03T00:54:42  <foobio> either you've got merge conflicts to resolve on the incoming feature branches or you've got revert conflicts to resolve ripping the dead code back out again
2014-05-03T00:54:49  <dstufft> well except one is mandatory to resolve or else you can't actually do the merge, and the other isn't and most projects are not very good at managing techincal deb and going back and removing things
2014-05-03T00:55:24  <dstufft> the second one can be poliically dificult too, because you end up with people who don't want that code ripped out but also don't want to actually finish the damn feature themselves ;)
2014-05-03T00:55:58  *** rhsu has quit IRC
2014-05-03T00:56:14  <foobio> in all probability i'd take the history of development work within the project for that committer into account when deciding whether the code needed to be fully baked or could be landed in several iterations
2014-05-03T00:56:16  *** lakshmiS has quit IRC
2014-05-03T00:57:39  <foobio> we've definitely had plenty of success with large features which were landed incrementally with multiple supporting changes which didn't all have to land in one shotgun blast to the head
2014-05-03T00:58:28  <dstufft> (I completely agree with the idea of breaking things down into smaller chunks to reduce the length of time to integration, even breaking down larger features into smaller features where possible, but each change should stand on it's own without needing guards to protect against that code running)
2014-05-03T00:58:43  <dstufft> It might be the smaller feature isn't particularly useful without something to consume it
2014-05-03T00:59:02  <foobio> from a code review perspective it's a time saver, because re-reviewing large patch series every time they're rebased on fast-moving projects eats a lot of time

2014-05-03T01:00:03  <foobio> if i can review one piece, and that lands, and then review the next piece, and that lands, and so on, the rebasing is kept to a minimum
2014-05-03T01:00:43  <foobio> as are the chances of errors introduced from botched rebases
2014-05-03T01:02:54  <dstufft> foobio: sure, breaking things into smaller stand alone features are good ;) my assertion is that breaking it into smaller half features is not ;P
2014-05-03T01:03:13  <dstufft> I do a lot of the first
2014-05-03T01:03:15  <dstufft> none of the second

2014-05-03T01:04:08  *** manishg has quit IRC
2014-05-03T01:04:41  <foobio> the first is definitely preferable, and the second is when i might end up weighing that option against the possibility of a slightly-longer-lived topic branch which verges on being a feature branch while not really being declared so formally as such
2014-05-03T01:05:21  <dstufft> I'd rather work on a feature branch than have half a feature in mainline
2014-05-03T01:05:21  *** manishg has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-03T01:05:26  <dstufft> rebasing isn't that hard
2014-05-03T01:06:37  <foobio> rebasing isn't itself hard, but rebasing repeatedly while trying to get a larger branch through review eats a lot of reviewers' time, so there's a trade-off

2014-05-03T01:12:29  <dstufft> Sure, though I think that's largely a function of how long a change sits and how many other changes land in the mean time. iow it's not clear to me that it would actually make anything better in say Openstack to land half features because you'd have (theortically) easier to review patches, but the number of merges would go up thus increasing the time between when a change is approved and when it is actually merged
2014-05-03T01:12:42  <dstufft> since how long it takes to run the tests is a fixed cost
2014-05-03T01:12:46  <dstufft> and that has to be done serially
2014-05-03T01:12:54  <dstufft> whereas reviewing can be done in parallel :D
2014-05-03T01:13:33  <dstufft> so in many ways you might end up increasing the rebasing

2014-05-03T02:43:30  <jbooboo> harlowja, anteaya: ^
2014-05-03T02:43:54  <harlowja> ah cool

2014-05-03T02:44:56  <jbooboo> harlowja: i built it on your change -- i added some things and removed a couple; let me know what you think
2014-05-03T02:45:05  <harlowja> looks fine
2014-05-03T02:45:31  <jbooboo> now starts the long process of un-learning "ctrl-\ quits" :)
2014-05-03T02:45:49  <harlowja> i was trying it out yesterday, and made the sqlite db have enabled for taskflow, am slightly unsure how to use it, but its a start :-P
2014-05-03T02:45:55  <harlowja> it did seem to try to suck down the taskflow reviews
2014-05-03T02:45:58  <harlowja> *i think
2014-05-03T02:45:58  <harlowja> ha
2014-05-03T02:46:28  <harlowja> like i see sync doing stuff, and openstack/taskflow on the main page
2014-05-03T02:46:57  <harlowja> but no reviews, should there be?
2014-05-03T02:47:46  <jbooboo> the basic idea is that when you select taskflow, you should see a list of changes you need to review, and once you review them, they should be hidden (but you can show/hide them, or mark/unmark them at will, kind of like email)
2014-05-03T02:48:12  *** moted has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-03T02:48:27  <jbooboo> i haven't quite gotten the semantics right around which things it should automatically consider reviewed yet.. but it errs on the side of considering them unreviewed...
2014-05-03T02:48:41  <harlowja> hmmm, ya, so first problem i had, was how to enable taskflow
2014-05-03T02:48:45  <jbooboo> so i'd sort of expect you to see some changes
2014-05-03T02:48:53  <harlowja> i had to go into the sqlite db and enable it, lol
2014-05-03T02:49:00  <jbooboo> yeah, the start with empty screen isn't a good ux.  :)
2014-05-03T02:49:11  <harlowja> hehe
2014-05-03T02:49:29  <jbooboo> the idea there is you should hit "l" to list all the projects, then "s" to subscribe to the ones you want
2014-05-03T02:49:52  <harlowja> ahhh, there it goes
2014-05-03T02:49:56  <harlowja> no i see them
2014-05-03T02:50:09  <harlowja> *now
2014-05-03T02:50:38  <jbooboo> all the screens have (at least a little bit) of help on f1, that sholud help you figure some of it out
2014-05-03T02:50:54  <harlowja> ya, mac f1 is weird, have to do function + f1, ha
2014-05-03T02:51:19  <jbooboo> oh man.  that's like the one thing terminals should never screw up.  :(
2014-05-03T02:51:19  *** sweston has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-03T02:51:26  <harlowja> :)
2014-05-03T02:51:36  <harlowja> ok, got to never sync nova, bad idea, lol
2014-05-03T02:51:52  <jbooboo> haha, yeah i have not tried that.  :)
2014-05-03T02:52:00  <harlowja> ya, i shouldn't have :-P
2014-05-03T02:52:21  <jbooboo> for now, we should probably just have it display the initial help screen if you start it with no subscribed projects
2014-05-03T02:52:32  <jbooboo> that will at least make things a little bit discoverable
2014-05-03T02:52:52  <harlowja> or just start with listing all projects if never subscribed  to anything before?
2014-05-03T02:52:59  <jbooboo> and we can put a note in there saying you might need to splat-f1 or alt-f1 etc...
2014-05-03T02:53:20  <jbooboo> well, then i'm worried people might not pick up on the 'subscribe' paradigm
2014-05-03T02:54:10  <harlowja> hmmm, or u can get all fancy, and have a tab that has all the projects, and tabs for each subscribed one
2014-05-03T02:54:11  <harlowja> haha
2014-05-03T02:54:34  <harlowja> maybe thats to much
2014-05-03T02:55:48  <jbooboo> that's not a bad idea, we might end up with something like that later, especially once it grows things like gerrit's dashboards (custom queries)

2014-05-03T02:59:55  *** ArxCruz has quit IRC
2014-05-03T02:59:56  <harlowja> ya, could be nice, but involves more urwid mastery, lol
2014-05-03T03:02:24  <harlowja> is pretty neat though
2014-05-03T03:02:41  <harlowja> for those console lovers out there
2014-05-03T03:03:24  <jbooboo> i'm pretty conversant in gtk and qt -- urwid is just close enough to them to make it seem easy, but just far enough away that it's actually quite hard...
2014-05-03T03:03:34  <harlowja> right
2014-05-03T03:03:48  <harlowja> i had similar feelings, ha
2014-05-03T03:04:14  <harlowja> better than using ncurses directly was my end feeling
2014-05-03T03:04:16  <harlowja> :)
2014-05-03T03:04:55  <jbooboo> i reviewed about 50 changes in gertty on wednesday -- i can't do everything in it yet, but after developing just a little bit of muscle memory, it was so much faster than using the web
2014-05-03T03:05:14  <jbooboo> and more pleasant too.  single page diff view ftw.  :)
2014-05-03T03:05:25  <harlowja> :)
2014-05-03T03:05:54  <jbooboo> (i've actually found myself going back too the change view in gertty a couple times looking for the next file to review only to realize i had already reviewed everything)

2014-05-03T03:07:04  <harlowja> ya, i'm gonna try to use it more, see how it works out
2014-05-03T03:08:31  <jbooboo> biggest gotchas right now are that it doesn't show dependencies, and if there are comments outside of the diffs, they aren't shown
2014-05-03T03:09:20  <harlowja> and it doesn't match my terminal colors :-P
2014-05-03T03:09:22  <harlowja> ha

2014-05-03T03:12:31  <jbooboo> oh, yeah, i figured we could add a theming option -- i think urwid makes that sort of thing pretty easy
2014-05-03T03:12:42  <harlowja> ya, i think so

2014-05-03T17:17:08  <foobio> test volume seems minimal, so i'm taking this opportunity to resize nodepool.o.o from a 2gb instance to 8gb. once it restarts i'll probably have to bump nodepoold again on it to get reporting to graphite to resume (based on prior experiences) and do a little cleanup on lost nodes, but in general it should all pass unnoticed unless you're staring at graphs

2014-05-03T17:44:14  <foobio> in unrelated news, the nodepool.o.o resize stopped a few minutes in and left the instance in an error state (at least nodepool is still up and running!). i've opened a support case with rackspace so they can look into it

2014-05-03T17:56:08  <foobio> setuptools strikes again!
2014-05-03T17:56:16  <foobio> setuptools 3.5 released today
2014-05-03T17:56:20  <foobio> https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
2014-05-03T17:57:04  <ildikov_> well, it was included in the error message that check setuptools doc..., so I could have thought immediately
2014-05-03T17:57:43  *** wenlock has quit IRC
2014-05-03T17:57:43  <foobio> yeah, but they've had so many releases recently i guess i secretly hoped they'd have settled down finally for a while
2014-05-03T17:58:38  <ildikov_> that pypy gate problem was also a setuptools issue, right? or something close to it
2014-05-03T17:59:26  *** etoews_ has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-03T17:59:30  <ildikov_> as for netifaces it was finally set as <=0.8 to be sure that we allow installing the latest version if it finally seems stable...
2014-05-03T17:59:43  *** wenlock has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-03T17:59:59  <foobio> ildikov_: it seemed like it at first, but later turned out to be different setuptools releases causing ordering differences which were sometimes either exposing or hiding the issue. the actual problem we had with pypy testing had to do with some py3k patches backported to pypy in the debian/ubuntu packaging

2014-05-03T18:15:10  <foobio> ildikov_: oh, it's also possible this is slightly older setuptools differences being exposed by new pip/virtualenv (also released today)
2014-05-03T18:16:07  <foobio> so it may take some more digging to untangle which of those releases (if any) is exposing the issue in sphinxcontrib-docbookrestapi
2014-05-03T18:17:55  <ildikov_> and I naively thought that this tiny little ptach will finally get landed soon...

2014-05-03T19:03:24  <foobio> harlowja_at_home: yeah, a bit. general consensus is that you should not post to technical mailing lists from addresses at corporate mtas or mass hosting grinders which implement strong dmarc enforcement

2014-05-03T19:03:36  <harlowja_at_home> foobio,  boo, lol
2014-05-03T19:04:11  <foobio> harlowja_at_home: an incorrect dkim signature is supposed to be treated no differently than a missing one, per the rfc
2014-05-03T19:05:07  <foobio> harlowja_at_home: so while we could consider stripping dkim headers entirely from messages, or munging the sender address to be the listserv, or a number of other unsavory workarounds, i'm unconvinced it's in the best interests of the project to do so
2014-05-03T19:05:45  <harlowja_at_home> foobio,  understood, to u know what other mailing lists are doing (it would seem to be a common issue thats popping up nowadays)
2014-05-03T19:05:48  <harlowja_at_home> *do u know
2014-05-03T19:06:17  <ildikov_> foobio: it seems that the netifaces fix can be ready before getting the quickfix patch landed...
2014-05-03T19:07:44  <foobio> harlowja_at_home: i'd have to go back and pull some specific examples of which lists were doing what to address it, but those were the basic options chosen among them
2014-05-03T19:07:57  <harlowja_at_home> foobio,  np (more just curious)
2014-05-03T19:10:10  <foobio> harlowja_at_home: the dmarc faq has some suggestions... http://dmarc.org/faq.html#s_3 (we could frame any more formal discussion around those if there's interest)
2014-05-03T19:11:10  <foobio> basically it serves as a concise list of the various compromises you, as a list operator, can engage in to cripple your mailing list features in one way or another
2014-05-03T19:11:11  <harlowja_at_home> intersting

2014-05-03T19:14:45  <foobio> i suppose if there's a plugin for mailman somewhere which takes care of that behind the scenes, then it could be considered

2014-05-03T19:17:53  <foobio> companies which implement dmarc and enforce it on their mail gateways are basically making a statement that they don't want to participate in the public e-mail network any longer, and want to stick to using it solely for internal, b2b or mass advertising
2014-05-03T19:19:38  *** mriedem has quit IRC
2014-05-03T19:20:34  <harlowja_at_home> foobio, i reason its a little to early to tell; i think it has somewhat good intentions (sender verification and such), but might need a few more iterations to become truely 'correct'
2014-05-03T19:21:38  <harlowja_at_home> but idk, i'm not really an expert :-P
2014-05-03T19:22:20  <foobio> well, it's not really verifying senders, it's verifying mailservers, which i think is part of my problem with the whole idea
2014-05-03T19:22:57  <harlowja_at_home> ah, good point, true
2014-05-03T19:23:06  <foobio> from the earliest vestiges of domainkeys and spf, they were being pushed by the mass-mail hosters to reduce the volume of undeliverable bounces they were getting flooded with because of spoofed spam and joe-jobs
2014-05-03T19:23:57  <foobio> dmarc effectively consists of solutions engineered to save mass mail hosters money

2014-05-03T19:29:50  <ildikov_> foobio: your suggested netifaces fix was just approved by the author so one problem will be solved with a new release soon
2014-05-03T19:32:52  <foobio> ildikov_: i saw! though we still need to work out what's doing on with sphinxcontrib-docbookrestapi and the namespace package error. i'll try to recreate that with a more refined test case momentarily
2014-05-03T19:34:38  <ildikov_> foobio: yes, I know, the Murphy factor in this that a new patch should be uploaded for netifaces too as the current one on the gate contains <=0.8
2014-05-03T19:34:40  *** _nadya_ has quit IRC
2014-05-03T19:36:17  <foobio> yeah, options there are to either ignore that there were a couple of broken netifaces releases the first two days of may, or explicitly append ,!=0.10.0,!=0.10.1 just in case someone ever tries to use those for some reason
2014-05-03T19:37:52  <ildikov_> foobio: you mean checking which latest version can be the cause of that issue?
2014-05-03T19:37:53  *** lnxnut has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-03T19:38:39  <foobio> ildikov_: well, first trying to reproduce it simply (could be as easy as trying to install sphinxcontrib-docbookrestapi in a fresh virtualenv)
2014-05-03T19:38:52  <ildikov_> foobio: I would go for the latter one, just to be sure, it does not worth another bug report
2014-05-03T19:39:17  <foobio> sounds fine to me
2014-05-03T19:42:00  <ildikov_> foobio: the new version is released, on Monday I can propose a new patch with these limitations
2014-05-03T19:42:46  <foobio> ildikov_: the reason i'm somewhat indifferent to those two options is that this wasn't really a "openstack doesn't work with those versions" bug, it was a "those versions are broken and uninstallable on some common platforms" bug
2014-05-03T19:43:19  <ildikov_> foobio: is that requirements gate job the only one that tries to install sphinxcontrib-docbookrestapi?
2014-05-03T19:43:20  <foobio> so i'm fine with whatever option gets picked
2014-05-03T19:44:41  <foobio> ildikov_: i'm not sure. that job may be an early warning in this case because it bypasses our pypi mirror, so it's potentially running into behaviors in new releases of things (setuptools, pip, virtualenv) which we aren't running in other jobs (yet)
2014-05-03T19:45:12  <ildikov_> foobio: that sounds reasonable

2014-05-03T19:48:06  <foobio> ildikov_: we've discussed that at a few summits now, and the consensus has been that by doing that we potentially blind ourselves to waiting problems
2014-05-03T19:49:21  <foobio> the best suggestion i've heard, though nobody's implemented it yet, is to have a reactionary periodic job which can find breakage like this on the already merged (and presumed working) state of projects, automatically opening bugs to alert us
2014-05-03T19:50:07  <foobio> and if possible, diffing the installed package list against previous runs to identify contenders (perhaps with further iterations downgrading one or more of those until the actual culprit is confirmed)
2014-05-03T19:52:15  <ildikov_> foobio: yeap, I was thinking about something similar, but I'm not surprised that nobody has implemented it yet
2014-05-03T19:53:27  <foobio> ildikov_: and the pain that we endure from testing the latest releases of so many popular python modules on multiple platforms is actually a great benefit to the wider community
2014-05-03T19:54:08  <foobio> bugs get reported upstream in a timely manner, and fixes get implemented hopefully before it actually impacts anyone in a production situation
2014-05-03T19:57:22  <ildikov_> foobio: yes, I was smiling on it today, when you said that not just setuptools was updated recently that there is an already reported bug on a newly released package, now the new release is out
2014-05-03T19:58:28  <ildikov_> foobio: and also there are the new issues already on the gate  on the day of the new release
2014-05-03T19:59:43  <ildikov_> foobio: so our gate does not only test OpenStack itself, which thing I knew, I just wasn't aware that how big the impact is
2014-05-03T20:00:14  <foobio> ildikov_: pretty much
2014-05-03T20:00:35  <foobio> ildikov_: so on the sphinxcontrib-docbookrestapi front, it's not setuptools 3.5 complaining
2014-05-03T20:00:49  *** Ryan_Lane has quit IRC
2014-05-03T20:00:52  <foobio> it's setuptools 3.4.4 (brought in by the new pip 1.5.5) complaining

2014-05-03T20:03:07  <ildikov_> foobio: I saw that version number in the doc, at least setuptools itself was a good guess
2014-05-03T20:03:15  <foobio> also, i've confirmed the nodepool.o.o resize, everything is back up and running cleanly. i'll remove any cruft nodes later once i see which are sticking around and not deleting on their own

2014-05-03T22:53:04  <foobio> nah, about to hack some more on evacuating virtual machines from my basement to a service provider so i don't have to take all this beat-up old hardware with me to the outer banks in a month
