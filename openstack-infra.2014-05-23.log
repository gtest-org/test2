2014-05-23T00:01:33  <superbee> that explains it, just not in graphite. jbooboo do we need to restart nodepool to get new graphite date?
2014-05-23T00:01:39  <superbee> jbooboo: yes there is at least one ready node in b4
2014-05-23T00:01:50  <superbee> it is used now
2014-05-23T00:01:53  <superbee> b3 has a ready node too
2014-05-23T00:01:54  <jbooboo> superbee: what explains it?
2014-05-23T00:02:13  <superbee> jbooboo: the data isn't ni graphite

2014-05-23T00:02:21  <superbee> hence no data, so not a bad query
2014-05-23T00:02:28  <jbooboo> superbee: that sounds more like the problem statement than the solution.  :)
2014-05-23T00:02:55  <jbooboo> superbee: i think we're on the same page now.
2014-05-23T00:05:04  <jbooboo> superbee: they are being sent to graphite, so the problem is not on the nodepool side
2014-05-23T00:05:21  <superbee> ok
2014-05-23T00:05:50  <jbooboo> wow.

2014-05-23T00:13:59  <superbee> thanks
2014-05-23T00:14:38  <jhesketh> jbooboo: if you have time to look at my comment on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/91310/4 that'd be good please :-)
2014-05-23T00:15:21  <jbooboo> jhesketh: actually i didn't have a problem looking at the change -- it turns out gertty handled that case much better than gerrit did
2014-05-23T00:15:49  <jhesketh> ah cool
2014-05-23T00:16:05  <jhesketh> I'm interested in what you think about keeping it in the current level of inline js etc
2014-05-23T00:16:13  <jhesketh> (I divided it up for neatness)
2014-05-23T00:16:31  <jbooboo> jhesketh: so about the html -- basically my concern was that at some point we added all of those sections to the status page.  and in the future, we might add/remove more
2014-05-23T00:16:59  <jhesketh> jbooboo: right, but why can't that be done in the HTML?
2014-05-23T00:17:05  *** fanhe has quit IRC
2014-05-23T00:17:08  <jbooboo> jhesketh: i like the idea that someone should be able to just drop this into an existing website (naturally, since that's what i want to do) without them needing to maintain it
2014-05-23T00:17:14  <superbee> ok rechecked 3 changes, that should generate a little load
2014-05-23T00:17:32  *** dstanek is now known as dstanek_zzz
2014-05-23T00:17:54  <jbooboo> jhesketh: the more stuff we put in the html, the harder that becomes (we have to change html that's external to zuul, which means we have to ask users to change it)
2014-05-23T00:17:59  <jhesketh> jbooboo: sure, but in my opinion it's not a large drop in.. in fact it's more flexible as you can drop in parts to integrate with your current page better (for example, maybe you want filters off to the side)
2014-05-23T00:18:34  <superbee> by the way I think the graphite delete numbers are off due to foobio's cleanup maybe
2014-05-23T00:18:43  <jhesketh> jbooboo: only if they want to add/remove sections themselves.. the point being that they can more easily choose which parts they consume
2014-05-23T00:18:48  <superbee> the purple on zuul status page is very big but nodepool list doesn't show that many
2014-05-23T00:19:00  <superbee> its only 35 according to nodepool
2014-05-23T00:19:20  <jbooboo> superbee: it doesn't look big to me
2014-05-23T00:19:27  <jbooboo> superbee: maybe you need to reload?
2014-05-23T00:19:32  <jbooboo> sometimes i think it stops updating
2014-05-23T00:20:31  <jbooboo> jhesketh: i'm not opposed to supporting that kind of flexibility, but i also think we can and should support the very simple case of 'drop this into your web page'.
2014-05-23T00:20:40  <jhesketh> sure, okay
2014-05-23T00:21:18  <jhesketh> so I actually toyed with moving more dom building out of the javascript and put it inline (for example building the filter form) to allow for more html flexbility
2014-05-23T00:21:37  <superbee> yes I needed to reload. that will teach me

2014-05-23T00:22:10  <jhesketh> or keep the dom as I currently have it and move more javascript back into a .js file

2014-05-23T00:22:49  <superbee> jbooboo: but if yo uapprove that it will generate more load

2014-05-23T00:23:35  *** matsuhashi has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-23T00:23:37  <jbooboo> jhesketh: my primary goal is to never have to change anything about the status page in the config repo other than css and stuff we stick above/below it (like graphs).  i think the best way to do that is to make the footprint there as small as possible, so i think it should be one dom element and one function call.
2014-05-23T00:24:17  <jbooboo> jhesketh: so maybe we can build the dom in the js in that case, but if someone wants to supply parts manually, handle that too
2014-05-23T00:24:32  <jbooboo> (if they're doing that, they're already more inclined to keep up with changing expectations of the js app)
2014-05-23T00:25:13  <SpamapS> jbooboo: regarding accounting even when nova creates somethign but returns error.. I wonder if you can use the name to do that sort of tracking (by only ever giving nova a unique name, if you see a name that you thought was an error, you should delete it, right?)
2014-05-23T00:25:35  <jbooboo> SpamapS: yeah, that's about the only solution.  it's really lame though.
2014-05-23T00:25:59  <SpamapS> jbooboo: agreed. Heat has this problem as well and that is the only way Heat can solve it too.
2014-05-23T00:26:12  <SpamapS> jbooboo: some people specced out an "idempotency key" for Nova, but it was rejected.
2014-05-23T00:26:28  <jbooboo> i feel like i can commiserate with them.

2014-05-23T00:27:17  <jbooboo> SpamapS: i want to know who thought it was a good idea to create a server after returning an error response.  i will shake my fist at them.  shake it i say.
2014-05-23T00:27:31  <jhesketh> jbooboo: okay, fair enough. I'll build the dom in a new javascript file, but I might do it on the tail of that change
2014-05-23T00:28:05  <jbooboo> SpamapS: yeah, our names are unique (the number in them is actually the db primary key), so it shouldn't be too hard.  it'll be just another instance of "don't actually believe the response code".
2014-05-23T00:28:08  <SpamapS> jbooboo: I'm pretty sure thats not by design. It happens when there are communication breakdowns between the client and api endpoint.. probably other times too
2014-05-23T00:28:17  <jbooboo> SpamapS: which is pretty much every time we get a response code.

2014-05-23T01:05:30  <jhesketh> jjb hurts my head... very difficult to visualise what the output will look like with all the macros and builders etc

2014-05-23T02:39:34  <mordred> lifeless: so, I grok that you do published releases, but we need to be able to test tip of git for things that participate in the gate
2014-05-23T02:39:43  <mordred> lifeless: mainly because the act of tagging and releasing is not gated
2014-05-23T02:39:58  <mordred> and we don't want to wedge the gate (this is not just theory, it's happened _many_ times before)
2014-05-23T02:40:27  <mordred> so while it's fine to have a mode that installs releases (and that's a thing we want to ADD to the devstack worldview)
2014-05-23T02:40:36  *** gyee has quit IRC
2014-05-23T02:40:50  <mordred> we also need to make sure we can feed in the states of the tip of the git repos for every repo that should be participating in the gate
2014-05-23T02:41:30  <mordred> and/or that the testing thing, such as whatever dib is doing, can be pointed at the set of repo-states that have been pre-prepared by the testing structure
2014-05-23T02:41:43  <superbee> mordred: initial numbers for the hpcloud network reconfiguration are promising
2014-05-23T02:41:47  <mordred> superbee: woot!
2014-05-23T02:41:53  <mordred> superbee: that's EXCELLENT to hear

2014-05-23T02:43:15  <mordred> lifeless: ALSO - since we want to more broadly be able to test "tip of branches vs. current released release things" in a non-tripleo context too
2014-05-23T02:43:49  <mordred> it would be great if any infrastructural needs to do that would be generalized in such a way that we're not repeating ourselve

2014-05-23T02:44:12  <lifeless> mordred: right, which derekhs approach does very nicely IMO
2014-05-23T02:44:20  <mordred> a good example of this is "test tip of master/proposed changes of all servers with currently released versions of client libs"
2014-05-23T02:44:22  <mordred> lifeless: awesome
2014-05-23T02:44:29  <lifeless> mordred: to whit: build a pip repo containing the zuul ref versions of things
2014-05-23T02:44:32  <mordred> lifeless: I'm mainly babbling here just to make sure we're on the same background page
2014-05-23T02:44:39  <lifeless> mordred: and install with that in the pip index list
2014-05-23T02:45:14  <mordred> lifeless: do you happen to know where I should look for derekh's stuff?
2014-05-23T02:45:18  <lifeless> mordred: we may also want/need version locking to do older things (but thats a fair thing to want when installing anyway)

2014-05-23T13:40:09  <openstackgerrit> Matthew Montgomery proposed a change to openstack-infra/gerritbot: Force SSL Configuration Parameter  https://review.openstack.org/95160

2014-05-23T13:42:42  <mordred> msabramo: usually just pinging me here is the right way - lemme go poke real quick (I'm actually, you know, working today)
2014-05-23T13:43:06  <mordred> I REALLY want reviewable tags in gerrit
2014-05-23T13:43:12  <mordred> zaro: ^^ this is a great example of the use case ...
2014-05-23T13:43:32  <mordred> zaro: msabramo _should_ be able to propose a tag with no special permissions - and I should be able to review it and accept or reject it
2014-05-23T13:44:11  <msabramo> mordred: OK, no pressure. That's why a some kind of tool or process for requesting would be nice, so you could handle it at your leisure

2014-05-23T13:44:28  <mordred> msabramo: yah. I agree
2014-05-23T13:44:51  <mordred> msabramo: I mean, in theory, filing a ticket in launchpad would be the 'right' way - but in practice, I'm actually less likely to see that
2014-05-23T13:45:19  <msabramo> yeah I get the feeling that Launchpad doesn't get looked at much by anyone?
2014-05-23T13:46:03  <msabramo> my coworker asked a question on the "ask" feature of Launchpad and it got closed after 15 days because of no response
2014-05-23T13:46:14  <mordred> oh, yeah - we _Definitely_ don't use the questions thing
2014-05-23T13:46:36  <msabramo> he was also asking for a new release, in this case he was asking for a new release of JJB
2014-05-23T13:46:53  <msabramo> so another example in favor of this reviewable tags feature
2014-05-23T13:47:12  <mordred> yah. I've wanted it for a while - I don't like tagging being a 'special' action only special people can do

2014-05-23T13:47:50  <mordred> it looks like there is nothing in pbr master that is a behavioral change for current things
2014-05-23T13:48:06  <mordred> it's essentially doc fixes, the addition of the coverage thign you want, and some logging improvements
2014-05-23T13:48:14  <mordred> so I think it can be 0.8.1 safely
2014-05-23T13:49:02  *** gokrokve has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-23T13:49:07  <msabramo> cool!
2014-05-23T13:49:46  <mordred> done.
2014-05-23T13:49:50  <msabramo> yeah the coverage thing will unblock a couple of reviews that can't be merged withoutit
2014-05-23T13:49:58  <msabramo> thank you!
2014-05-23T13:50:08  <mordred> it may take a little bit for that to filter to our mirror - BUT - I don't think any of the reviews waiting on it use our mirror
2014-05-23T13:50:33  <mordred> and it's on pypi
2014-05-23T13:50:33  <msabramo> ah I see it on PyPI now

2014-05-23T14:18:59  <foobio> cody-somerville: i want to say that looks like a java bug. i wouldn't think that a java program should be likely to cause the java interpreter to overflow and trigger a __fortify_fail in libc
2014-05-23T14:19:39  <foobio> but i am not really very hip to java, so i could be entirely wrong about that
2014-05-23T14:19:46  <mordred> yah. sounds like "oops, java derped"
2014-05-23T14:19:58  <cody-somerville> It's probably issue in _nss_ldap_getgrgid_r. Java is in process of making native call.

2014-05-23T14:21:41  <foobio> also, i don't think we wrote the java gearman server. i believe zaro merely incorporated an existing one into the jenkins-gearman plug-in
2014-05-23T14:25:08  <foobio> another possibility, though... are you maybe running a stand-alone gearman server for zuul instead of the pure python implementation integrated with it?

2014-05-23T14:26:53  <foobio> because if this was the jenkins plugin and a /usr/bin/java process was terminated, i would think that would have torn down the entire jenkins service as it runs entirely within a jvm

2014-05-23T14:58:09  <mordred> jbooboo, foobio: we _are_ still gettting some errors at some peaks
2014-05-23T14:58:27  <mordred> which might suggest that the optimal ratio is still a little bit lower of nodes/network
2014-05-23T14:58:47  <mordred> but the theory that nodes per network is related to the issues seems to be holding up under data
2014-05-23T14:59:24  <openstackgerrit> Marc Abramowitz proposed a change to openstack-infra/jenkins-job-builder: Add tox "coverage" target  https://review.openstack.org/87382
2014-05-23T14:59:33  <foobio> yeah, maybe adding a couple more nets and dropping down to 150 per
2014-05-23T14:59:59  <foobio> i guess we could get to that with just one more
2014-05-23T15:01:17  <jbooboo> mordred: well i think we had a revised theory yesterday that it wasn't some vague "more is worse" thing, but actually superbee found that the network only had 256 ips because it was a /24.
2014-05-23T15:01:25  <jbooboo> foobio: ^

2014-05-23T15:04:23  <foobio> oh, i was misremembering how many we'd put in each network too. for some reason i though it was 188
2014-05-23T15:04:30  <foobio> thought
2014-05-23T15:04:36  <foobio> but yeah, 114 each at the moment
2014-05-23T15:05:28  <mordred> I'm only seeing errors now when we reach the apex of that - so there still may be a scaling issue at play

2014-05-23T15:05:37  *** yongli has quit IRC
2014-05-23T15:05:40  <mordred> but the 256 hard limit is _certainly_ a thing
2014-05-23T15:05:49  <mordred> oh - I wonder if there is an ip release delay
2014-05-23T15:06:37  <jbooboo> good question; i would hope that as soon as the server is deleted the ip/port would be available again
2014-05-23T15:06:44  *** wenlock has quit IRC
2014-05-23T15:06:54  <mordred> yah. but if it's not, then that could explain the error spikes as we hit the tip of things
2014-05-23T15:07:12  <mordred> like, either there is an arp cache problem, or there's just another async queue thing
2014-05-23T15:07:56  <jbooboo> yeah.  that would be annoying.  if we have the information, we can deal with it.  nodepool includes deleting servers in its calculations, so it should never request more than half the network.
2014-05-23T15:08:16  <jbooboo> but if that's hidden, then we're in the dark
2014-05-23T15:08:29  <mordred> yah
2014-05-23T15:08:36  <mordred> worth investigating
2014-05-23T15:08:56  <mordred> although also, the error rate at the moment is completely within the normal operational margin of errors we see other places
2014-05-23T15:09:03  <mordred> I mean, it's less than the rax regions

2014-05-23T15:29:53  <jbooboo> but still, after looking at the whole list, i do think codenames are the right way to go, and if enough people think so too, i think we should probably defer the spec renames today and then talk about renaming the 5 we approved earlier

2014-05-23T16:21:53  <msabramo> can probably check it by doing `python setup.py egg_info` and expecting the metadata that gets generated
2014-05-23T16:21:57  <anteaya> foobio when next you feel like splunking the gerrit db, chuckC (I have just discovered) has two accounts, so can you bring the contents of 9093 into 11598?
2014-05-23T16:22:20  <anteaya> he also has two foundation profiles, I don't yet know how to fix that

2014-05-23T16:22:33  <anteaya> he wasn't showing up in stackalytics and tried some stuff
2014-05-23T16:22:36  <zaro> jbooboo, SergeyLukjanov : would it make sense to combine python coverage job with the py26 and py27 jobs?

2014-05-23T16:24:38  <anteaya> it is preserved for historical reasons
2014-05-23T16:24:43  <foobio> pafuent: it's only ever used once for the initial import and then ignored after
2014-05-23T16:24:47  <msabramo> zaro: hmmm seems to work in my git tree, so maybe it was already fixed
2014-05-23T16:24:50  <pafuent> anteaya: OK. So the blazar repo on github will be created using the actual climate code, right?
2014-05-23T16:25:03  <foobio> pafuent: correct
2014-05-23T16:25:17  <msabramo> although my AUTHORS is from May 1

2014-05-23T16:31:44  * zaro is just as clueless
2014-05-23T16:32:18  <msabramo> might've been related to the setup.cfg change but that is a wild guess
2014-05-23T16:32:21  <zaro> what would be the result of an empty AUTHORS file?
2014-05-23T16:32:22  <foobio> chuckC: it looks like your two accounts are entirely separate. one is from a launchpad account with a ccarlino@ e-mail address and ssh username of ChuckC circa 2013-10-21, while the other is for chuck.carlino@ and ssh chuckcarlino created yesterday

2014-05-23T16:50:45  <mgagne> Is there anything preventing someone from publish twice the same version on tarballs.o.o? Does the use of signed tags the only way to make such release idempotent if it ever happen?
2014-05-23T16:51:25  <mordred> mgagne: the use of signed tags and the fact that he don't really let people delete tags
2014-05-23T16:51:53  <mordred> since releases are tied to tags, the way to fix a botched release is to bump version and go again

2014-05-23T16:54:03  <zaro> mordred, superbee, jbooboo : does it make sense to generate coverage with one of the python jobs that run tests?
2014-05-23T16:54:17  <mgagne> mordred: how can someone consume projects from trunk as an egg? Is there a place where egg are generated and could be used/tested before a release or is it left to an exercise to this potential user/dev?
2014-05-23T16:54:35  <mordred> mgagne: we don't generate eggs, but we do generate source tarballs of trunk
2014-05-23T16:54:46  <mordred> and they're at tarballs.o.o/$projectname/$projectname-master.tar.gz
2014-05-23T16:54:48  <mgagne> zaro: IMO, coverage should be split into its own job
2014-05-23T16:54:52  <mordred> (it gets overwritten each time)

2014-05-23T17:19:19  <foobio> anteaya: yes, starting a new change loses the review history for the previous change, but since gerrit doesn't currently have a mechanism to transfer change ownership that's about the only option besides bugging the original owner or core reviewers to wip and un-wip it for you
2014-05-23T17:19:43  <superbee> mordred: reviewing it now
2014-05-23T17:19:46  <anteaya> foobio: so zaro suggestion is the accepted process?
2014-05-23T17:19:51  <anteaya> zaro's
2014-05-23T17:20:07  <foobio> anteaya: accepted or not, it's basically the only available process

2014-05-23T17:21:20  <Alex_Gaynor> superbee: did all the images get updated?
2014-05-23T17:22:09  <foobio> Alex_Gaynor: the loop i started to regenerate the py3k-precise image in hpcloud-az2 is still trying after several days
2014-05-23T17:22:18  <Alex_Gaynor> foobio: womp womp :-( computers
2014-05-23T17:22:27  <foobio> Alex_Gaynor: there's a good chance we'll stop using that az before we get a fresh image in it

2014-05-23T17:25:51  <superbee> mordred: what graphs for 1.1 are you looking at? I don't see any red
2014-05-23T17:25:58  <foobio> mordred: upgrading .tox/venv to pbr 0.8.1.1.gd580d56 (your change) and rerunning setup.py sdist in it gets me an 82-line AUTHORS file for python-swiftclient now
2014-05-23T17:26:12  <superbee> oh needed to widen the time range. I see red now
2014-05-23T17:26:36  <pelix> foobio: does git on precise have 'shortlog'?
2014-05-23T17:27:01  <foobio> pelix: yep
2014-05-23T17:27:03  *** dripton_ is now known as dripton
2014-05-23T17:27:21  <pelix> might require less code as it's supposed to use mailmap behind the scenes
2014-05-23T17:27:47  <foobio> pelix: yeah, the manpage for git-shortlog does indicate that it applies .mailmap
2014-05-23T17:27:54  <pelix> git shortlog --format="%aN <%aE>" --summary -e
2014-05-23T17:28:18  <pelix> get rid of the count in front and I think you should have your authors list
2014-05-23T17:28:24  *** marcoemorais has quit IRC
2014-05-23T17:28:33  <foobio> pelix: though git log also respects .mailmap for certain format macros

2014-05-23T17:30:16  <superbee> and I can approve it right now, tag a release and everyone is happy
2014-05-23T17:30:26  <superbee> with shortlog I have to be paranoid because we are reverting for raisins

2014-05-23T17:31:47  <mordred> I verify that foobio's command uses mailmap

2014-05-23T17:32:32  *** marcoemorais has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-23T17:32:55  <pelix> foobio: when it says respects .mailmap, does the 'see git-shortlog(1) or git-blame(1)'  just mean that it only applies to when you use those commands, as instead of reproducing the full format list, those man pages redirect you to the man page 'git-log(1)' for the allowed format strings
2014-05-23T17:33:02  *** Ryan_Lane has quit IRC
2014-05-23T17:33:08  <mordred> foobio: so, actually, you're saying that the canonicalize_emails line may be useless
2014-05-23T17:33:22  <mordred> as may the --use-mailmap option
2014-05-23T17:33:27  <mordred> since that's the default behavior
2014-05-23T17:33:31  *** amcrn has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-23T17:33:44  <foobio> pelix: it seems to use them for git log, based on my testing
2014-05-23T17:33:51  <mordred> like, we may have been overthinking this the whole tie
2014-05-23T17:33:54  <superbee> mordred: jbooboo: so trying to understand the 1.1 experiment. We are doing more nodes per network:router to see if it holds up?
2014-05-23T17:33:59  <mordred> superbee: yeah
2014-05-23T17:34:11  <mordred> superbee: to see if the _actual_ problem was exceeding the 256 nodes in a /24
2014-05-23T17:34:15  *** alugovoi has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-23T17:34:28  <pelix> foobio: wonder why it even has the option --use-mailmap for git-log so
2014-05-23T17:34:49  <jbooboo> superbee: mordred still sees some failures, so we're trying to correlate failure rate with % of network range used
2014-05-23T17:35:06  *** nati_ueno has quit IRC
2014-05-23T17:35:22  <mordred> jbooboo: failure rates are actually flatlined now
2014-05-23T17:35:25  <mordred> not seeing any
2014-05-23T17:35:48  <mordred> but also request rate is low
2014-05-23T17:35:50  <jbooboo> mordred: but use is low
2014-05-23T17:35:53  <mordred> yah
2014-05-23T17:35:55  <foobio> pelix: it may be that --use-mailmap extends mailmap use to macros like %an without having to explicitly use %aN instead
2014-05-23T17:35:58  <superbee> ya we need to ramp up use
2014-05-23T17:36:11  <superbee> we can push ~10 d-g changes and zuul will go crazy
2014-05-23T17:36:36  <pelix> foobio: ah, well that's nice and unintuitive of the git devs
2014-05-23T17:37:16  <superbee> mordred: revert is +2 from me
2014-05-23T17:37:21  <foobio> i confirm that using "%an <%ae>" produces un-mailmap-deduped output while "%aN <%aE>" seems to apply the .mailmap

2014-05-23T17:38:19  <mordred> dhellmann, superbee: what do you think? the full revert? or a new patch that just removes the --use-mailmap?

2014-05-23T17:39:00  <superbee> if we can test the smaller change I think that is better, but we should properly test it
2014-05-23T17:39:06  *** lttrl has quit IRC
2014-05-23T17:39:45  <foobio> mordred: removing --use-mailmap and diffing the result against the AUTHORS file generated by the revert shows that it introduces two additional authors... Jenkins <jenkins@review.openstack.org> and OpenStack Jenkins <jenkins@openstack.org>

2014-05-23T17:40:23  <mordred> foobio: oh - because we filter those specifically in the thing
2014-05-23T17:40:33  <mordred> let's land the revert then

2014-05-23T17:42:16  <dstufft> mordred: the best thing about packaging is how hacks (pbr) ontop of hacks (setuptools) ontop of terrible (distutils) conjoin with more hacks and terrible (pip) to create a big ball of sad
2014-05-23T17:42:37  <mordred> dstufft: that is, in fact, my favorite part about it
2014-05-23T17:42:48  <mordred> everyone will tell you I prefer big balls of sad
2014-05-23T17:43:53  <dstufft> Someday I'm going to write a book about all the terrible things people do in their packaging tools and why they are bad and should feel bad
2014-05-23T17:44:34  <mordred> it should be titled that
2014-05-23T17:44:56  <Alex_Gaynor> "One time I tried to install a package: A memoir, by Donald Stufft"
2014-05-23T17:44:58  <foobio> mordred: ftr, the jenkins account stripping seems to happen elsewhere outside of the revert, so the AUTHORS file generated by 95225 is identical to that generated by 88627, at least where python-swiftclient is concerned
2014-05-23T17:45:25  <mordred> foobio: god, really?
2014-05-23T17:45:54  <mordred> foobio: oh - wait - you're right, it is in there
2014-05-23T17:45:57  *** UtahDave has quit IRC
2014-05-23T17:46:10  <mordred> foobio: so you're saying that both commits, as best you can tell, produce something akin to "correct" ?
2014-05-23T17:46:26  <foobio> tested installing pbr 0.8.1.1.g8581fea (change 95225) vs pbr 0.8.1.1.gd580d56 (change 88627)
2014-05-23T17:46:54  <mordred> then if the simple one fixes it too - I vote for the two line change over the revert
2014-05-23T17:46:55  <foobio> md5sum of the AUTHORS file produced by both is identical
2014-05-23T17:46:56  <mtreinish> foobio, sdague: so here's something fun when I went to push the '1' tag for tempest I get: "! [remote rejected] 1 -> 1 (prohibited by Gerrit)"
2014-05-23T17:47:01  <mordred> jbooboo, superbee, dhellmann ?
2014-05-23T17:47:20  <foobio> mtreinish: acl on the tempest project in gerrit probably. checking
2014-05-23T17:47:42  <mtreinish> oh I just assumed 1 was reserved, but that makes more sense :)
2014-05-23T17:47:42  <dhellmann> yeah, I've also seen that when I didn't have the ssh key right but the acl is the most likely cause
2014-05-23T17:48:38  <foobio> mtreinish: yep, acl isn't set up to allow tags. i'll propose a change for you real fast
2014-05-23T17:48:40  <dstufft> mordred: someday i'd like to hammer out an idea I keep thinking of, something that would move the stuff that pbr does to package creation time instead of at setup.py execution time
2014-05-23T17:49:15  <superbee> mordred: either way is fine with me if we can test the new solution

2014-05-23T17:50:30  <mordred> dstufft: I was talking with notmyname about it at the summit - my lame version of talking about that is having pbr shove a static generated setup.py into the sdists it creates
2014-05-23T17:50:46  <superbee> wouldn't it be nice if we cold just get rid of setup.py completely?
2014-05-23T17:50:51  <dstufft> superbee: it'll happen
2014-05-23T17:50:52  <mordred> superbee: well, yeah.
2014-05-23T17:50:59  <dstufft> I promise you, it'll be an option at some point

2014-05-23T17:56:28  <openstackgerrit> Jeremy Stanley proposed a change to openstack-infra/config: Allow tempest tags and release tarballs  https://review.openstack.org/95230
2014-05-23T17:56:29  <foobio> mtreinish: ^
2014-05-23T17:56:33  <mordred> jbooboo: because git does them naturally with the format string we're using
2014-05-23T17:56:44  <mordred> jbooboo: --use-mailmap is not needed, and it doesn't exist on precise git
2014-05-23T17:57:09  <mordred> jbooboo: foobio | i confirm that using "%an <%ae>" produces un-mailmap-deduped output while "%aN <%aE>" seems to apply the .mailmap
2014-05-23T17:57:17  <mordred> jbooboo: ^^ that's the relevant two format strings
2014-05-23T17:57:20  <jbooboo> yowza.
2014-05-23T17:57:26  <mordred> right?
2014-05-23T17:57:32  <foobio> mordred: jbooboo: if you look at the manpage for git-log circa ubuntu precise, it explicitly calls out that %aN and %aE apply .mailmap
2014-05-23T17:57:48  <mordred> so, --use-mailmap makes %an use mailmap settings like aN
2014-05-23T17:57:59  <mordred> because $sanity
2014-05-23T17:58:25  <jbooboo> okay.  well in that case i rather like 95225 which, like superbee, i have not tesed :)
2014-05-23T17:58:48  <mordred> I think that's my preference too
2014-05-23T17:58:50  <jbooboo> but i have read the manpage and agree with foobio that it says that :)
2014-05-23T17:58:51  * foobio will paste up a confirmation of it working
2014-05-23T17:58:57  <foobio> if it helps
2014-05-23T17:59:34  * mordred +A'd it
2014-05-23T17:59:57  <mordred> ok. I'm going to grab food. I'll be back before the great rename of death
2014-05-23T18:00:22  <foobio> basically cherry-picking each of those changes (the revert and the command line cleanup), installing them into the .tox/venv for a pbr-using project which has a .mailmap and doing the sdist dance via tox for each of them produces an identical AUTHORS file
2014-05-23T18:00:54  <mtreinish> foobio: thanks
2014-05-23T18:00:55  <foobio> on the platform we're using to generate tarballs
2014-05-23T18:01:24  <mtreinish> one thing though is I don't think there is a tempest-ptl gerrit group. Or was that to create it?
2014-05-23T18:01:43  <foobio> mtreinish: it will get created automagically, but i can make that a different group if you want
2014-05-23T18:02:18  <foobio> mtreinish: also, note that if you ever plan to start making tempest pip-installable, we probably need to think hard about what to do regarding https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Tempest
2014-05-23T18:02:18  <mtreinish> no that's fine I can't imagine anyone else needing to push a tag
2014-05-23T18:04:22  <mtreinish> hmm, yeah that could be an issue although I don't think we have any plans to do that right now

2014-05-23T18:13:06  <jesusaurus> :)
2014-05-23T18:13:08  <superbee> approved
2014-05-23T18:13:17  <superbee> reed: as an op you need to /topic this is my new topic
2014-05-23T18:13:31  <superbee> reed: I think you should have perms right?
2014-05-23T18:13:35  <reed> superbee, next question, how do I get op? :)
2014-05-23T18:13:59  <jbooboo> reed: /msg chanserv op #openstack-community reed
2014-05-23T18:14:10  <pleia2> you can just /msg chanserv topic #openstack-community blah blah blah
2014-05-23T18:14:12  <pleia2> no need to op up
2014-05-23T18:14:16  <jbooboo> pleia2: ++
2014-05-23T18:14:32  <jbooboo> reed: we should start a wiki page for the irc ops, maybe listing the team members and helpful commands like this
2014-05-23T18:15:01  <reed> ah! thanks
2014-05-23T18:15:33  <reed> maybe I should have consulted freenode help page
2014-05-23T18:15:48  <openstackgerrit> Joshua Harlow proposed a change to openstack-dev/pbr: Teach PBR about envra versions (useful for rpms).  https://review.openstack.org/95234
2014-05-23T18:15:48  <reed> I thought that openstackstatus had something to do with the topic
2014-05-23T18:16:35  *** dprince has quit IRC
2014-05-23T18:16:40  <foobio> reed: it can change the topic temporarily if we're experiencing project-wide infrastructure issues we need to warn everyone to be alert for
2014-05-23T18:16:59  <foobio> but it should change it back on its own afterward to whatever it was before
2014-05-23T18:17:11  <reed> cool, no problem
2014-05-23T18:17:20  <reed> I'll read the docs on freenode next time
2014-05-23T18:17:28  <reed> not sure we need to duplicate info on our wiki
2014-05-23T18:18:26  <superbee> so what do people think about me pushing ~10 throwaway changes to d-g in order to exercise hpcloud 1.1?
2014-05-23T18:18:30  <reed> what's openstack-attic?
2014-05-23T18:18:41  <superbee> is that just wasteful and we wait for monday/tuesday to see how it handles load?
2014-05-23T18:18:53  <jbooboo> superbee: go for it
2014-05-23T18:18:59  <jbooboo> reed: where we're putting projects we've abandoned
2014-05-23T18:19:00  <superbee> reed: it is the island of misfit toys^H^H^H^Hrepos
2014-05-23T18:19:18  <Alex_Gaynor> So many people have bene making "island of misfit toys" references lately.
2014-05-23T18:19:22  <openstackgerrit> A change was merged to openstack-infra/config: Move openstack-specific config out of ::jenkins  https://review.openstack.org/89708
2014-05-23T18:19:28  * nibalizer is rememebering the dollhouse attic
2014-05-23T18:19:29  <reed> for some reason I thought that the attic was a good place to be :)
2014-05-23T18:19:43  <foobio> superbee: exercising hpcloud region b hardly seems wasteful however you do it
2014-05-23T18:19:55  <foobio> reed: when it floods, perhaps ;)

2014-05-23T19:03:19  <SergeyLukjanov> zaro, enabling coverage could affect some testing IMO (at least increase time for running them)
2014-05-23T19:03:21  <superbee> (well actually because google accounts are silly apparently, but still this is annoying)

2014-05-23T19:05:59  <SergeyLukjanov> superbee, for todays renaming session
2014-05-23T19:06:15  <SergeyLukjanov> sounds like we decided to keep codename-based naming for specs
2014-05-23T19:06:18  <superbee> SergeyLukjanov: right, but do they need updating?
2014-05-23T19:06:20  <superbee> oh that
2014-05-23T19:06:29  <mtreinish> foobio: so should we try this again as "1.0"?
2014-05-23T19:06:38  <SergeyLukjanov> probably we need to rename spec repos that are now named using the program name
2014-05-23T19:06:40  <mtreinish> and just ignore the minor version unless we need it
2014-05-23T19:06:47  <superbee> SergeyLukjanov: maybe we can put those changes at the end of the list so that we can use them if we want but ignore them if we don't want them
2014-05-23T19:07:07  <superbee> I don't really care much about what we call them so will defer to jbooboo and others
2014-05-23T19:07:18  <SergeyLukjanov> superbee, I'll recheck changes and reorder them
2014-05-23T19:07:21  <anteaya> SergeyLukjanov: there is still an email thread being discussed about that
2014-05-23T19:07:48  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, probably we should to postpone the specs renaming for some time when we'll decide about it?
2014-05-23T19:07:51  <anteaya> SergeyLukjanov: so some renames is deferred for today: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/repo-renaming-2014-05-23
2014-05-23T19:08:14  <anteaya> SergeyLukjanov: yes, that is what has been decided, postpone the specs renaming
2014-05-23T19:08:27  <superbee> mordred: jbooboo the error rate after my d-g push looks really similar to the error rate from before. I think that means it is independent of network:router numbers and size
2014-05-23T19:08:32  <foobio> mtreinish: nah, we should fix our regex. looking at dstufft's suggestion momentarily

2014-05-23T19:08:46  <anteaya> project renaming, climate to blazar, barbican and to -attic is still a go
2014-05-23T19:08:53  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, are we postponing the whole renaming or only specs?
2014-05-23T19:08:57  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, oh, got it ;)
2014-05-23T19:09:02  <anteaya> :D
2014-05-23T19:09:22  <dstufft> foobio: PEP 440 isn't locked down yet, so it's still subject to changing but https://github.com/dstufft/packaging/pull/1
2014-05-23T19:09:42  <anteaya> superbee: so the early indications are we move to Google+ signin, OAuth2.0 signin or spin our own
2014-05-23T19:09:49  <anteaya> superbee: do I read that correctly?
2014-05-23T19:10:19  <superbee> anteaya: not quite, that is for upstream
2014-05-23T19:10:33  <superbee> anteaya: gerrit still supports other auth mechanisms. They are suggestion they will remove openid though
2014-05-23T19:10:46  <anteaya> and we use openid right?
2014-05-23T19:11:04  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, foobio, I'll cleanup changes in the next hour
2014-05-23T19:11:36  <anteaya> SergeyLukjanov: I think it is mostly fixing the dependencies, is it not?
2014-05-23T19:11:51  <anteaya> I think all the patches are in good shape vote-wise
2014-05-23T19:11:56  <jesusaurus> jbooboo: my refactor missed two things: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/95249/ is needed for puppet to run on the jenkins masters, https://review.openstack.org/#/c/95252/ is a matter of sanity and cleanliness
2014-05-23T19:12:00  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, I think yes
2014-05-23T19:12:05  <anteaya> SergeyLukjanov: k
2014-05-23T19:12:24  <anteaya> SergeyLukjanov: if you need stuff re-reviewed, I'm standing by
2014-05-23T19:12:30  <jbooboo> SergeyLukjanov, superbee, foobio, mordred: yeah, i think the consensus is heading toward codenames, so at this point i'm pretty sure we should not rename repos that currently have a codename
2014-05-23T19:12:42  <SergeyLukjanov> anteaya, thanks!
2014-05-23T19:13:44  <jbooboo> SergeyLukjanov, superbee, foobio, mordred: i've gotten explicit confirmation from devananda and notmyname that they are okay with renaming their program name repos to codename; haven't heard from dolphm eglynn or zaneb yet

2014-05-23T19:27:42  <devananda> jbooboo: side note, for renaming baremetal-specs, we'll also need to rename the review team
2014-05-23T19:28:02  <foobio> dstufft: yeah, it has so far, though it's worth debating whether we want to support that or reject it

2014-05-23T19:31:14  <mtreinish> foobio: doesn't that still need a period because of the "+\."? (I suck at regex for the record)
2014-05-23T19:31:40  <foobio> mtreinish: ? means 0 or 1 instance of the element
2014-05-23T19:31:53  <foobio> mtreinish: so \.? means no \. or only one \.
2014-05-23T19:32:10  <foobio> mtreinish: oh, you're talking about the release regex, not the prerelease one
2014-05-23T19:32:28  <foobio> mtreinish: the ()* takes care of that (any number of including 0 of)
2014-05-23T19:33:02  <foobio> so the missing match against ([0-9]+\.) is fine because * allows to match 0 times
2014-05-23T19:33:16  <mtreinish> foobio: yeah I was, ok cool just wanted to check
2014-05-23T19:33:39  <foobio> whereas before the + meant 1 or more occurrences of the ([0-9]+\.) element

2014-05-23T19:35:50  <dstufft> foobio: one of the PEP people is a Red Hat employee, so I sure hope so :)
2014-05-23T19:36:04  <foobio> having a defined mechanical transform between all of those will be useful
2014-05-23T19:36:13  <dstufft> I can add that to the list
2014-05-23T19:36:19  <dstufft> though we have some of that already
2014-05-23T19:36:31  <dstufft> roughly informal though more of a "well here's how you could do it"
2014-05-23T19:36:53  <foobio> tricky part is to deal with how different schemes represent pre-versioning vs post-versioning for non-releases

2014-05-23T20:30:31  <jbooboo> and then we can go back to real work :)
2014-05-23T20:30:33  <SergeyLukjanov> jbooboo, okay, I'll do it now

2014-05-23T20:42:11  <SergeyLukjanov> superbee, it should be state = read only

2014-05-23T21:29:52  <superbee> but worth testing to see
2014-05-23T21:30:10  <superbee> since we don't see errors until we get to >=100 nodes ish
2014-05-23T21:30:20  <foobio> greater than two digits is clearly the problem. it's y2k all over again!
2014-05-23T21:31:03  <jbooboo> i'm waiting for one more change about to report
2014-05-23T21:31:34  <superbee> so once this is all done I think we go back to 5 providers with max servers set to 100 each then recheck no bug my test d-g changes

2014-05-23T21:45:13  <jbooboo> foobio: i think so
2014-05-23T21:45:23  <foobio> going once...
2014-05-23T21:45:25  <foobio> twice...
2014-05-23T21:45:31  <foobio> starting
2014-05-23T21:45:55  <jbooboo> so... do we want to actually run all of SergeyLukjanov's changes through the gate or just force-merge them?
2014-05-23T21:46:06  <foobio> first i need to rename those two groups, right?
2014-05-23T21:46:24  <jbooboo> foobio: puppet is stopped, so order isn't critical there
2014-05-23T21:46:34  <foobio> good point
2014-05-23T21:46:46  <jbooboo> starting zuul
2014-05-23T21:46:58  <superbee> github is done
2014-05-23T21:47:25  <foobio> so we should probably run them through the gate just in case we have merge conflicts somehow (i didn't 100% confirm the change dependency chain)?
2014-05-23T21:47:43  <jbooboo> zuul is not starting; debugging that now
2014-05-23T21:47:58  <foobio> well, zuul did get new code
2014-05-23T21:48:06  <foobio> swift stuff
2014-05-23T21:48:14  <superbee> jbooboo: ugh it could be that the removal of the project id was insufficient. I tested swiftclient in python interpretter but not zuul directly
2014-05-23T21:48:18  <jbooboo> foobio: we can, though gerrit will still bomb out on merge conflicts
2014-05-23T21:48:33  <foobio> fair enough
2014-05-23T21:48:37  <superbee> jbooboo: if that is the case can you try setting the project id to something wrong eg 'myproject' and see if that fixes it?
2014-05-23T21:48:53  <superbee> though we had something wrong in there before and it didn't work... yay clouds
2014-05-23T21:48:56  <jbooboo> it's an un-logged startup error :( so it'll take a minute to diagnose
2014-05-23T21:49:03  <mordred> jbooboo: yay!
2014-05-23T21:49:05  <foobio> i can go ahead and merge those changes then while you're debugging zuul

2014-05-23T21:57:25  <jbooboo> SergeyLukjanov: nope, all ok.
2014-05-23T21:57:32  <superbee> but our python clients are so ridiculously meta programmed that you can't determine how any of the args are supposed to work

2014-05-23T21:57:54  <mordred> superbee: but that means that the args can be introspected by the factories that introspect the args from the factory factories

2014-05-23T21:59:24  <jbooboo> foobio: i'm guessing we should try to keep series like this based on master -- it seems like as long as it can FF it's okay, but merge commits bomb out after 4 on a branch

2014-05-23T22:00:31  <superbee> sdague: mordred: so I think I know my way around python relatively well, and the fact that even after RTFS'ing I can't figure out how to auth with keystone is ridiculous
2014-05-23T22:00:43  <sdague> superbee: agreed
2014-05-23T22:00:46  <mordred> sdague: I do not believe jbooboo is kidding, btw
2014-05-23T22:00:51  <superbee> ideally it would just be documented, but the code is available so the fact it isn't documented means I can read the code, but its just scary
2014-05-23T22:01:04  <sdague> mordred: yeh... so it would require unwinding some of the tempest conf bits
2014-05-23T22:01:06  * mordred blames morganfainberg
2014-05-23T22:01:08  <jbooboo> foobio: renaming groups now?
2014-05-23T22:01:11  <superbee> I really like how command line arg parsing happens
2014-05-23T22:01:20  <sdague> which... honestly I've considered doing as part of this
2014-05-23T22:01:25  <superbee> there is about 5 layers of indirection to parse a single argument

2014-05-23T22:02:34  <anteaya> jbooboo: *nod
2014-05-23T22:02:37  <jbooboo> anteaya: and it's the only thing left on the etherpad, but we still have more on http://ci.openstack.org/gerrit.html
2014-05-23T22:02:42  <sdague> the tempest clients aren't a gold standard by any means, but, they are a bit more straight forward
2014-05-23T22:02:45  <notmyname> mordred: I stepped away. back now, and I see in scrollback that you're using my name in vain and cursing swift. or something. what's up?
2014-05-23T22:03:08  <superbee> notmyname: we continue to be unable to auth against rax swift due to rax id service
2014-05-23T22:03:20  *** otherwiseguy has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-23T22:03:30  <mordred> notmyname: we're mainly cursing auth
2014-05-23T22:03:31  <superbee> notmyname: the state of client code has not helped our debugging but it is keystoneclient not swiftclient that is the problem
2014-05-23T22:03:37  <anteaya> jbooboo: thanks, following along
2014-05-23T22:03:48  <mordred> notmyname: but we happen to be doing swift, so we're cursing you for good measure

2014-05-23T22:03:55  <superbee> the root of the problem is rackspace having an ID service that does not return a complete catalog when you provide a correct tenant name
2014-05-23T22:03:59  <jbooboo> we should probably delay this conversation for a few minutes to make sure we don't miss anything

2014-05-23T22:04:29  <foobio> groups renamed in gerrit now
2014-05-23T22:04:47  <jamielennox> superbee: keystoneclient is a mess because it's trying to change and keep backwards compatability
2014-05-23T22:04:50  <jamielennox> what are you trying to do/
2014-05-23T22:04:53  <notmyname> mordred: also, just to clarify, is there any issue with the swiftclient release? AFAIK, everything is ok there
2014-05-23T22:05:04  <jamielennox> (also they all suck)
2014-05-23T22:05:13  <anteaya> jamielennox notmyname we have the conversation on pause for a few more moments please
2014-05-23T22:05:14  <superbee> foobio: marked that off on the etherpad
2014-05-23T22:05:23  <jbooboo> foobio, mordred: so do we need to do the jenkins cleanup step on our persistent slaves?
2014-05-23T22:05:25  <anteaya> foobio is still finishing up the rename
2014-05-23T22:05:31  <jbooboo> mordred: do we still have solt running such that we can do that?
2014-05-23T22:06:01  <foobio> jbooboo: mordred: i think the pypi upload and proposal slaves may need it
2014-05-23T22:06:28  <foobio> should be the same list of project names which needed deleting from github
2014-05-23T22:06:30  <superbee> yup
2014-05-23T22:06:31  <jbooboo> superbee: can you work on that?
2014-05-23T22:06:39  <superbee> sure I will start on pypi.slave
2014-05-23T22:06:47  * SergeyLukjanov lurking
2014-05-23T22:06:53  <jbooboo> foobio: i think we're ready to re-enable puppet in review now
2014-05-23T22:07:05  <superbee> just removing the workspaces correct?
2014-05-23T22:07:11  <foobio> jbooboo: done
2014-05-23T22:07:13  <foobio> superbee: yes
2014-05-23T22:07:44  <jbooboo> foobio, mordred: so shall i just run the "run_all" script in screen on ci-puppetmaster to kick us back off again?
2014-05-23T22:07:57  <superbee> actually it will be naything that was renamed too because the git remotes have changed
2014-05-23T22:08:03  <foobio> jbooboo: unless you want to have manage-projects run separately
2014-05-23T22:08:08  <superbee> I will delete workspaces for any renamed or deleted things on github
2014-05-23T22:08:21  <superbee> oh wait nevermind new name == new workspace
2014-05-23T22:08:22  <foobio> superbee: renamed things are fine, just cruft

2014-05-23T22:35:08  <superbee> notmyname: swiftclient is fine. This is a known problem with rax id made worse by being unable to understand how to pass bogus data to keystoneclient
2014-05-23T22:36:06  <superbee> if you provide swiftclient a tenant_name or id when authenticating against rax id you do not get a complete catalog. The catalog you get does not have an object files entry. To get the object files enty you need to provide ' ' as your tenant_name
2014-05-23T22:36:20  <jamielennox> superbee: this doesn't sound like a problem with keystoneclient
2014-05-23T22:36:21  <superbee> when I testsed it appeared that passing None as tenant_id worked but zuul threw up on that so apparently not
2014-05-23T22:36:41  <superbee> jamielennox: it isn't. The problem in keystone client is figuring out how to auth in the first place
2014-05-23T22:36:52  <superbee> made more complicated by needing to pass in bogus data
2014-05-23T22:36:57  *** otherwiseguy has quit IRC
2014-05-23T22:37:02  <jamielennox> superbee: right, so auth has changed recently and it means it routes all over the place
2014-05-23T22:37:08  <superbee> when I tested keystoneclient directly I got it to work with a None tenant_name
2014-05-23T22:37:18  <superbee> when zuul uses it it dies
2014-05-23T22:37:21  <jamielennox> you need CLI or the library?
2014-05-23T22:37:27  <superbee> library
2014-05-23T22:37:33  <superbee> and I have no idea what is going on because its spaghetti
2014-05-23T22:37:54  <jamielennox> superbee: subclass https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/blob/master/keystoneclient/auth/base.py with something that makes sense for rax
2014-05-23T22:38:27  <superbee> I'm guessing that zuul constructs a client in a subtley different way than I was doing it in python directly which results in complettely different code paths
2014-05-23T22:38:29  <jamielennox> yea - backwards compatability is a bitch, especially when the initial thing sucks so much that people were hacking into it directly
2014-05-23T22:39:38  <superbee> looking at http://paste.openstack.org/show/81238/ again I think swift may actually be checking for the tenant_name and not keystoneclient
2014-05-23T22:39:47  <superbee> so while keystoneclient is cool with a None tenant_name swiftclient is not
2014-05-23T22:39:57  <superbee> which arguable is fine because tenant_ids should be athing you use
2014-05-23T22:40:10  * superbee reads more code
2014-05-23T22:42:31  <jamielennox> swiftclient is extracting that from keystoneclient
2014-05-23T22:42:34  <jamielennox> ?
2014-05-23T22:42:50  <superbee> not sure yet
2014-05-23T22:43:13  <superbee> if (not 'tenant_name' in os_options): # nope swiftclient does the check itself
2014-05-23T22:43:19  <superbee> notmyname: so maybe swiftclient is at fault
2014-05-23T22:43:24  *** shivharis has joined #openstack-infra
2014-05-23T22:43:28  <superbee> but it depends on whether or not tenant_name is actually a required thing
2014-05-23T22:43:42  <superbee> jamielennox: is tenant_name required to auth with keystone?
2014-05-23T22:44:25  <jamielennox> not required

2014-05-23T22:45:35  <Alex_Gaynor> Of note on Rackspace for cloud-files you get a different tenant_id than for everything else
2014-05-23T22:45:46  <superbee> Alex_Gaynor: hrm really?
2014-05-23T22:45:49  <mordred> Alex_Gaynor: oh?
2014-05-23T22:45:49  <jamielennox> Alex_Gaynor: oh, joy
2014-05-23T22:45:50  <superbee> maybe that is part of the problem
2014-05-23T22:46:00  <mordred> so maybe if we configure to use _that_ id
2014-05-23T22:46:02  <superbee> because using the regular tenant id I don't get object files in the catalog
2014-05-23T22:46:03  <superbee> mordred: ya
2014-05-23T22:46:03  <Alex_Gaynor> superbee: Yes, if you look at the raw service catalg you can see it. Specifying tenant_id=" " works around this
2014-05-23T22:46:03  <mordred> we'll get a proper catalog?
2014-05-23T22:46:18  <superbee> Alex_Gaynor: yes thats the workaround but is there actually another tenant id? and if so wtf
2014-05-23T22:46:30  <superbee> I will look into this
2014-05-23T22:46:30  <mordred> Alex_Gaynor: but we can't specify tenant_id=" " in our case  ... can we get the tenant_id itself?
2014-05-23T22:46:51  <Alex_Gaynor> mordred: Yeah, you could look at the raw service catalg and grab it, not sure if there's a better way
2014-05-23T22:46:59  <mordred> that's fantastic
2014-05-23T22:47:06  <Alex_Gaynor> Yeah :-(
2014-05-23T22:47:12  <shivharis> anteaya: hi
2014-05-23T22:47:12  <jamielennox> in theory you could get the unscoped token and then list the tenants you hae access to
2014-05-23T22:47:17  <mordred> quite literally nobody has ever tried to use any of these services nor seem to care about actual users
2014-05-23T22:47:27  <mordred> because that's just insane
