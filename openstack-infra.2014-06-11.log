2014-06-11T00:01:44  <openstackgerrit> A change was merged to openstack-infra/config: Gate Gnocchi against MySQL too  https://review.openstack.org/97820
2014-06-11T00:04:02  <superbee> jesusaurus: http://logs.openstack.org/19/96319/3/check/gate-config-puppet-apply-precise/b81795f/console.html.gz#_2014-06-03_06_35_47_752 is that a known thing?
2014-06-11T00:04:37  <jesusaurus> superbee: for https://review.openstack.org/#/c/98561/ how strongly do you feel about using a single script rather than copying the prepare_node* architecture for the ready_* scripts?
2014-06-11T00:05:03  <superbee> jesusaurus: pretty strongly... I think that if we end up needing additional scripts we can split them at that point
2014-06-11T00:05:18  <superbee> jesusaurus: but starting this way will only lead to drift that we don't intend

2014-06-11T00:05:35  <jesusaurus> superbee: yeah, that error you linked to will be resolved by https://review.openstack.org/#/c/97659/
2014-06-11T00:05:56  <superbee> jesusaurus: cool, I have been trying to get those through so that we can eventually gate on that test
2014-06-11T00:06:00  <superbee> jesusaurus: I just approved the selinux cleanup
2014-06-11T00:06:10  <superbee> and approved the apache name change earlier
2014-06-11T00:06:45  <jesusaurus> superbee: sweet
2014-06-11T00:07:17  <openstackgerrit> Dan Bode proposed a change to openstack-infra/config: Allow modules to be installed from source  https://review.openstack.org/96336
2014-06-11T00:07:18  <jesusaurus> superbee: and okay, i'll change 98561 to be a single ready script
2014-06-11T00:07:43  <morganfainberg> sdague, so we don't avoid logging the token, but i'll get that fix in for the next KSC release.

2014-06-11T00:09:04  <jesusaurus> bodepd: how familiar are you with r10k? how much effort would it be to turn install_modules.sh into a wrapper for r10k?
2014-06-11T00:10:11  <bodepd> jesusaurus: I'm not sure how much sense it makes to use r10k if you are not using environments
2014-06-11T00:10:30  <bodepd> jesusaurus: it's pretty opinionated around an environmnets based workflow
2014-06-11T00:10:45  <bodepd> jesusaurus: the problem with environments is they kind of don't work
2014-06-11T00:11:47  <bodepd> jesusaurus: that being said, it should be able tp replicate what you guys are doing
2014-06-11T00:13:11  <bodepd> jesusaurus: this might be a better conversation for #puppet the author is usually hanging out in there
2014-06-11T00:13:12  <jesusaurus> oh, i didnt realize r10k was strongly opinionated about environments

2014-06-11T00:14:05  <bodepd> jesusaurus: it has some kind of librarian-puppet-ish support
2014-06-11T00:14:18  <bodepd> jesusaurus: but I found it to work in surprising ways and not be that well documented

2014-06-11T00:14:58  <AaronGr> jesusaurus: i just started using it personally, against a single environment, works well, and easily
2014-06-11T00:15:03  <jesusaurus> bodepd: good to hear, im still at the 'this looks useful' stage of learning about it
2014-06-11T00:17:05  <superbee> mordred_phone: mordred: you should read https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/nodepool-dib-integration when you have a free moment
2014-06-11T00:18:10  <bodepd> superbee: that's funny, I've been thinking about the same thing today
2014-06-11T00:18:20  <bodepd> superbee: but I'm using packer
2014-06-11T00:18:51  <superbee> bodepd: packer is in and odd place because it doesn't really add anything
2014-06-11T00:19:07  <superbee> bodepd: it can do the proper VM image builds but those have all the same issues
2014-06-11T00:19:12  <bodepd> superbee: what do you mean?
2014-06-11T00:19:13  <superbee> at least for our need
2014-06-11T00:19:31  <bodepd> superbee: it calls out to a list of shell scripts
2014-06-11T00:19:33  <superbee> bodepd: as far as the goals go we do something today that is very packer like and it doesn't quite meet what we want
2014-06-11T00:19:39  <superbee> bodepd: right its basically what we do today
2014-06-11T00:19:43  <superbee> and we would like to be better
2014-06-11T00:20:02  <bodepd> superbee: what's an example of 'better'?
2014-06-11T00:20:09  <superbee> bodepd: the goals on that ethperad
2014-06-11T00:20:17  <bodepd> coo
2014-06-11T00:20:20  <superbee> the first paragraph
2014-06-11T00:21:34  <superbee> bodepd: the first item is the tricky one
2014-06-11T00:21:52  <superbee> bodepd: we basically require people today to hae an hpcloud or rax account if they want to reproduce exactly on their own
2014-06-11T00:24:06  <superbee> bodepd: packer does have the various backends going for it, but in practice I think your scripts will only work on one
2014-06-11T00:24:19  <superbee> at least that has been my experience trying to make this stuff work in a chroot
2014-06-11T00:24:35  <openstackgerrit> A change was merged to openstack-infra/config: Only include selinux bits on rhel-based systems  https://review.openstack.org/96319
2014-06-11T00:26:11  <bodepd> superbee: why do you need different images per provider?
2014-06-11T00:26:27  <bodepd> superbee: couldn't you just generate a single img file and use it anywhere?
2014-06-11T00:26:51  <superbee> bodepd: in theory yes, until recently we could not provide a base image and had to rely on what the provider gives you
2014-06-11T00:26:59  <superbee> bodepd: that is still true for most customers of hpcloud aiui
2014-06-11T00:27:13  <superbee> so to get a 1:1 you have to start with that

2014-06-11T00:28:07  <bodepd> my hope is that I can reliably build images for vbox and openstack using the same script sets and a single defintion (which should be possible using a single image specification)

2014-06-11T00:30:35  <superbee> bodepd: ya we set up our mysql and postgres DBs for the test suites and that requires modifying user permissions and creating a database

2014-06-11T00:35:50  <sarob> superbee: i can reorg all of the projects if that will make it pass
2014-06-11T00:35:53  <bodepd> superbee: yep, now I understand the issue. You guys should just move to docker if you have to refactor the whole thing

2014-06-11T00:37:40  <superbee> sarob: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/96334/9/modules/openstack_project/files/review.projects.yaml that is the file
2014-06-11T00:37:52  <sarob> superbee: the projects are kind of grouped similar
2014-06-11T00:37:53  <superbee> bodepd: we have a deployment mechansim. `nova boot`
2014-06-11T00:38:02  <bodepd> superbee: no, but if you have to move away from services, it would at least be worth looking into
2014-06-11T00:38:24  <sarob> superbee: the test is looking for every project name in the file to go from a -z?
2014-06-11T00:39:07  <superbee> sarob: yes, we did that to avoid merge conflicts. Prior to that everyone added to the end of the file and merge conflicted everywhere
2014-06-11T00:39:29  <sarob> superbee: ill take care of it
2014-06-11T00:39:33  <sarob> superbee: patch soon
2014-06-11T00:39:45  <superbee> sarob: it should only be those 3 lines in that file that need moving
2014-06-11T00:40:59  <sarob> superbee: there is no project name alpha sort or pattern i can see
2014-06-11T00:41:27  <superbee> sarob: there should be in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/96334/9/modules/openstack_project/files/review.projects.yaml

2014-06-11T00:42:22  <superbee> lifeless: yes it is related to the number of projects you are watching and the number of changes in those projects

2014-06-11T01:32:14  <superbee> foobio: are you comfortable with me +2 +A'ing 94440 given that I edited it?
2014-06-11T01:32:49  <superbee> I noticed your comment saying jhesketh mordred_phone and SergeyLukjanov should +2 which means I think you don't want me "self approving"
2014-06-11T01:33:01  <superbee> jhesketh: SergeyLukjanov mordred_phone mordred: on that note can you review 94440?
2014-06-11T01:33:12  <superbee> would be excellent to have that in
2014-06-11T01:35:03  <jhesketh> superbee: Is this a different initial commit, or am I confusing this with a different repository
2014-06-11T01:35:25  <jhesketh> ah yes, I'm confusing it with infra-manuals
2014-06-11T01:35:27  <foobio> superbee: yeah, i'm cool with it, though the more +2s from cores the better
2014-06-11T01:35:29  *** dims__ has quit IRC
2014-06-11T01:35:34  <jhesketh> I'll take a look shortly
2014-06-11T01:35:44  <foobio> since this is defining our planning process
2014-06-11T01:36:43  <foobio> i'd like to show some additional core solidarity on it, but i also don't want it to rot any longer than it already has
2014-06-11T01:37:25  <foobio> and it's not immutable so i guess we can still fix later disagreements if needed
2014-06-11T01:38:32  <superbee> ++ I think if jhesketh is happy with it then we can go ahead and merge

2014-06-11T01:43:23  <superbee> jhesketh: I am looking at 98306, are we assuming that the USED flag in the DB will be updated without zmq?
2014-06-11T01:43:39  <superbee> jhesketh: I believe today that that flag is set when zmq emits the onbuildstarted event
2014-06-11T01:43:57  <jhesketh> superbee: No, the USED flag won't be set
2014-06-11T01:44:22  *** aysyd has quit IRC
2014-06-11T01:44:36  <jogo> jhesketh: turbo hipster seems to be reporting fails in nova on docstring changes
2014-06-11T01:44:47  <superbee> jhesketh: that change sets n_used from the DB though
2014-06-11T01:44:54  <jhesketh> jogo: link please?
2014-06-11T01:44:55  <jogo> superbee: when are folks arriving on Germany?
2014-06-11T01:45:00  <superbee> jogo: sunday I think
2014-06-11T01:45:18  <superbee> I arrive at ~9am
2014-06-11T01:45:20  <jhesketh> superbee: that's counting the number currently used
2014-06-11T01:45:24  <superbee> have an overnight flight
2014-06-11T01:45:35  <superbee> jhesketh: right which comes from the DB USED flag
2014-06-11T01:45:38  <superbee> which comes from zmq
2014-06-11T01:45:40  <jogo> jhesketh: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/98376/
2014-06-11T01:45:59  <superbee> jhesketh: I think your math is sound. I am just making sure I grok the separation from zmq
2014-06-11T01:46:13  <jhesketh> superbee: right, so if you aren't running zmq there will be no used nodes

2014-06-11T01:47:15  <jogo> superbee: cool, and whats the cool hotel
2014-06-11T01:47:23  <jogo> jhesketh: oh I exaggerated a little ;)
2014-06-11T01:47:24  <jhesketh> sometimes the timing stuff in turbo-hipster is wrong because nodes are hard to predict
2014-06-11T01:47:30  <superbee> jogo: I booked at the maritim konferenz hotel in darmstadt
2014-06-11T01:47:46  <jogo> superbee: thanks
2014-06-11T01:47:51  * jogo books his travel
2014-06-11T01:48:09  <jhesketh> jogo: as of 30min ago turbo-hipster now uses nodepool rather than rerunning on the same nodes. This has actually helped with less false positives (in our testing) probably due to the way the nodes are scheduled by nova
2014-06-11T01:48:13  *** miqui has joined #openstack-infra
2014-06-11T01:48:17  <jhesketh> so hopefully false positives will see a reduction from today
2014-06-11T01:48:31  <superbee> jhesketh: nice
2014-06-11T01:48:36  <jogo> jhesketh: woot
2014-06-11T01:48:44  <jhesketh> "hopefully"...
2014-06-11T01:48:57  <superbee> jhesketh: it is prboably too late in the day for me to review this nodepool change. I do not understand how this helps if n_used is always 0 in your calculations
2014-06-11T01:50:10  <jhesketh> superbee: removing running_jobs from start_demand is what helps us
2014-06-11T01:50:44  <superbee> oh I see I was focusing on the wrong half
2014-06-11T01:50:45  <jhesketh> because our "running" amount will be higher when not using zmq
2014-06-11T01:51:18  <jhesketh> even though "running" may be "used" for us
2014-06-11T01:51:32  <superbee> jhesketh: oh running won't be equal?
2014-06-11T01:51:50  <jhesketh> equal to which?
2014-06-11T01:51:53  *** thuc_ has quit IRC
2014-06-11T01:52:22  <superbee> jhesketh: the non zmq number
2014-06-11T01:52:27  *** thuc has joined #openstack-infra
2014-06-11T01:52:38  <superbee> jhesketh: running is a gearman value and should be the same if you use jenkins + zmq or turbo hipster
2014-06-11T01:52:46  <jogo> wow flights from SFO to FRA are $$$
2014-06-11T01:52:48  *** signed8bit is now known as signed8bit_ZZZzz
2014-06-11T01:53:01  <superbee> jogo: ya I think because summer and all that
2014-06-11T01:54:16  <superbee> jhesketh: but I can see how removing that subtraction forces your needed nodes higher

2014-06-11T01:59:59  <superbee> mordred fixed it today but apparently did not rerun it
2014-06-11T02:00:22  <boris-42> superbee so I should just wait a bit?
2014-06-11T02:00:28  <superbee> boris-42: so I think we just need someone to babysit it at some point
2014-06-11T02:01:01  <superbee> boris-42: but once that happens your group should be created and we can add you to that
2014-06-11T02:01:11  <superbee> I would run it now but I am fading fast and need to head home
2014-06-11T02:01:12  <boris-42> superbee group is already created

2014-06-11T02:01:30  <superbee> so I can add you to the group now

2014-06-11T03:17:35  <superbee> jhesketh: ^ that should fix it
2014-06-11T03:17:45  <superbee> if it looks good to you I will probably self approve
2014-06-11T03:19:04  <superbee> jhesketh: it evaluates to `grep -q /etc/hosts` when that variable is empty :/
2014-06-11T03:19:40  <jhesketh> superbee: why is it empty?
2014-06-11T03:20:00  <superbee> jhesketh: because nodepool doesn't actually pass that data into the scripts... jesusaurus fixes that in a nodepool change that I think you reviewed
2014-06-11T03:20:14  <jhesketh> right, yeah I did see that
2014-06-11T03:20:17  <superbee> I believe it was a thing that may have carried over from the pre nodepool days that wasn't properly implemented in nodepool
2014-06-11T03:20:51  <jhesketh> okay, lgtm
2014-06-11T03:23:13  <superbee> alright I have just approved that change and will rebuild images once that makes it onto things
2014-06-11T03:23:38  <superbee> I am going to shift back to swift logs now that dib is giving me problems. I need dib to ferment a bit

2014-06-11T03:58:56  <superbee> ttx would be the person to ask thoug
2014-06-11T03:59:09  <kashyap> superbee, Alright. Yes, since it's time-based release model, I think of course it should be possible.
2014-06-11T03:59:23  <kashyap> I only asked because, I don't see any discussion of release on the dev mailing list :)
2014-06-11T03:59:32  <superbee> well its not really a release, it is a milestone
2014-06-11T03:59:40  <kashyap> Right, poor wording
2014-06-11T03:59:41  <superbee> things will be tagged, testing will happen, bugs will be fixed

2014-06-11T13:52:43  <SergeyLukjanov> foobio, ttx, sorry, everything is ok
2014-06-11T13:52:51  <foobio> SergeyLukjanov: the versions of pip new enough to notice and install wheels from pypi are also new enough to regognize release and non-release version numbers, and won't pull in the latter by default even if they're newer than the most recent release
2014-06-11T13:53:35  <foobio> SergeyLukjanov: so the plan has been to publish releases to pypi as both wheels and tarballs, while only publishing wheels to pypi for non-release tags
2014-06-11T13:54:15  <foobio> SergeyLukjanov: though this may be the first time that's happened (i wasn't expecting sahara to be on pypi since most of our server projects don't publish to pypi, just clients/libraries/tools/data)
2014-06-11T13:55:18  <foobio> SergeyLukjanov: this actually points out a kink in that plan, which is that we probably don't want pypi displaying only the beta release for a project

2014-06-11T13:57:43  <SergeyLukjanov> foobio, there is hide:yes/no dropdown for each version on pypi (I'm looking now on sahara package)

2014-06-11T14:01:53  <foobio> mordred: the main concern is that the next time someone does a prerelease of, say, novaclient, the way we've been setting up these entries people browsing pypi are only going to see the beta listed rather than the most recent release

2014-06-11T14:03:06  <foobio> basically just an unanticipated side-effect of the new plan, i think

2014-06-11T16:15:45  <trinaths> foobio: to publish these to FTP server, I need to give a generic path to a specific build. Will Jenkins know about the ZUUL variables.
2014-06-11T16:17:21  <yolanda> foobio, so if that's triggered from puppet agent, it should be logged into puppet?
2014-06-11T16:17:37  <foobio> trinaths: ZUUL_CHANGE and ZUUL_PATCHSET are provided from zuul to jenkins as job parameters and also reflected in the job's shell environment as variables
2014-06-11T16:17:55  <foobio> yolanda: yes, probably logged to syslog

2014-06-11T16:18:27  <foobio> yolanda: or wherever your puppet agent is logging detailed output (which may require an additional exec option in the manifest to turn that on)

2014-06-11T17:31:01  <morganfainberg> as a thought, have we considered the ability to tag (maybe) 3rd Party bug systems (e.g. 3rd party CI testing) w/ results? (cc rcarrillocruz)
2014-06-11T17:31:02  <foobio> superbee: long term solutions? larger es cluster, larger local volumes on existing cluster members, or less retention?

2014-06-11T17:52:42  <gary-smith> foobio: but if nothing has changed, why does it need to reverify? Isn't it just doing the same build over again?
2014-06-11T17:52:44  <morganfainberg> Alex_Gaynor, It may not _actually_ be a module, six.moves is weird.

2014-06-11T17:56:14  <gary-smith> foobio: for horizon, the unit tests are generally performed entirely without the rest of openstack, so it doesn't matter if the rest of openstack changes
2014-06-11T17:56:22  <superbee> jogo: I think one of the things we should keep in mind is that we aren't really running more tests (we are capped by provider quotas) so this increase is purely in what we are logging

2014-06-11T19:01:59  <superbee> restarting gerrit is expensive and it isn't closing the socket properly so you hit the old server with a different known host

2014-06-11T19:03:59  <foobio> in which case it's only a key verification failure as a side effect of not getting an actual key at all

2014-06-11T19:09:49  <foobio> superbee: it may be worth revisiting. i don't think we've seen this in production, unlike hashar, and we do use bc in production (because it's required by gerrit's contactstore feature)
2014-06-11T19:10:04  <superbee> yup
2014-06-11T19:10:08  <hashar> zaro: excellent :) Approve +1

2014-06-11T19:14:54  <superbee> hashar: ya that is the ssh server we use but I thought bouncy castle could be used to read/write the key files
2014-06-11T19:15:04  *** shayneburgess has quit IRC
2014-06-11T19:15:07  <superbee> hashar: so bouncy castle isn't doing the ssh server it is just dealing with keys
2014-06-11T19:15:13  <superbee> foobio: ^ that sound right to you?
2014-06-11T19:15:30  <hashar> superbee: yeah my contact told me bouncycastle is basically a crypto library
2014-06-11T19:16:38  *** ominakov has quit IRC
2014-06-11T19:16:57  <foobio> superbee: hashar: yes. i believe the ssh server comes with its own internal implementations of the cryptographic primitives it needs, but can use better implementations from bc if it's installed and available

2014-06-11T20:08:41  <lifeless> I'm sure there are some basic axioms we don't hold in common driving this
2014-06-11T20:08:45  <sdague> ok, so lets start on e-r, because I think I can frame that
2014-06-11T20:09:07  <sdague> e-r grew up from 'gate on fire' as basically the #1 tool to help us fight that
2014-06-11T20:09:12  *** e0ne has joined #openstack-infra
2014-06-11T20:09:17  <sdague> and has grown very organically since then
2014-06-11T20:09:58  *** markmcclain has quit IRC
2014-06-11T20:10:04  <sdague> my concern, right now, about adding things that aren't actually the integrated gate into it, is we're at a tipping point in the dashboards in getting really confusing again
2014-06-11T20:10:14  *** ramashri has joined #openstack-infra
2014-06-11T20:10:58  <sdague> given some of the ironic bits that landed already, I already have to mentally filter out the dashboards of 'not relevant' to the 15 hr gate backlog I've got
2014-06-11T20:11:16  <sdague> everything in there used to be relevant to the task at hand
2014-06-11T20:11:37  *** alkari has joined #openstack-infra
2014-06-11T20:11:46  <lifeless> ok, so there is a tragedy of the commons effect on folk debugging the integrated gate reliability
2014-06-11T20:11:59  <lifeless> is it purely mental overhead or are there technical considerations as well ?
2014-06-11T20:12:06  <sdague> lifeless: yes, there is a massive tragedy of the commons on that
2014-06-11T20:12:08  <lifeless> e.g. performance, scale, latency,....
2014-06-11T20:12:17  *** cody-somerville has quit IRC
2014-06-11T20:12:26  <sdague> so there is definitely mental overhead
2014-06-11T20:12:55  <sdague> I don't know if there is yet a performance impact on ES
2014-06-11T20:13:06  <sdague> I'm not really sure which pieces you are indexing there
2014-06-11T20:13:19  <sdague> though, ES hasn't been able to keep up with the data flow in 3 days now
2014-06-11T20:13:22  <lifeless> ok
2014-06-11T20:13:29  *** bnemec has quit IRC
2014-06-11T20:13:37  <sdague> so we're actually pretty blind, last I looked we're 12 hrs behind indexing job output
2014-06-11T20:13:41  *** nati_ueno has quit IRC
2014-06-11T20:13:51  <lifeless> so, factoid, tripleo today is a fairly small fraction of dvsm log load
2014-06-11T20:13:52  <sdague> and we really need to be within 5 minutes
2014-06-11T20:13:59  <lifeless> but it won't stay that way
2014-06-11T20:14:00  <sdague> lifeless: yep, I assumed as such
2014-06-11T20:14:13  <lifeless> ok
2014-06-11T20:14:46  <sdague> the value on the bot that reports to gerrit decreases dramatically after 15 minutes
2014-06-11T20:15:00  <sdague> to the point that we give up, because people are probably looking at their fail already
2014-06-11T20:15:03  <lifeless> so for now, I think E-R scale needs to handle dvsm and work done to scale that will easily compensate for the low tripleo load; as tripleo grows this will change but I expect tripleo to be behind the problem-curve for some time yet
2014-06-11T20:15:19  <sdague> yep, so that part we need to anticipate
2014-06-11T20:15:21  <lifeless> '...dvsm, and....'
2014-06-11T20:15:30  <sdague> the mental load bit is a real problem today
2014-06-11T20:15:34  <lifeless> ok
2014-06-11T20:15:47  <lifeless> pcrews: yo
2014-06-11T20:16:08  <pcrews> lifeless: howdy
2014-06-11T20:16:12  <sdague> which is why I last responded with if we are going to expand scope beyond the core gate, we need to work on the dashboards first to support that, because we *can't* make it any harder for people to work on gate bugs
2014-06-11T20:16:32  <lifeless> pcrews: up for some E-R hacking, sdague and I are discussing some things and the outcome is likely going to be a few bits of work
2014-06-11T20:17:10  <lifeless> sdague: so interestingly the dashboards are less interesting for us than the comments on reviews, but not uninteresting, if you see what I mean.
2014-06-11T20:17:31  <pcrews> lifeless: most definitely :)
2014-06-11T20:17:31  <sdague> lifeless: so that confuses me
2014-06-11T20:17:43  <sdague> how are you addressing actually fixing the races?
2014-06-11T20:17:54  <lifeless> sdague: I think I can unconfuse you when we swing back around to the tripleo situation
2014-06-11T20:18:06  <lifeless> sdague: if you can mentally box it up for now, lets stay on your needs
2014-06-11T20:18:34  <sdague> lifeless: honestly, I think that's the bulk of it
2014-06-11T20:18:46  <lifeless> sdague: ok
2014-06-11T20:18:54  <sdague> but, just as an asside
2014-06-11T20:19:07  *** dkehn has quit IRC
2014-06-11T20:19:07  <lifeless> so I'm not familiar with ER's codebase in detail, but from what I can tell there are two dashbords - base and uncategorised?
2014-06-11T20:19:27  <sdague> realize that all the folks that do e-r things, including the reviews, are also the ones that are the biggest gate firefighters
2014-06-11T20:19:34  <superbee> lifeless: neat I will have to find your change and apply it locally
2014-06-11T20:19:38  <sdague> so when you come asking things when the gate is backed up, you will get flamed :)
2014-06-11T20:20:11  <sdague> or you'll find them short of patience at least
2014-06-11T20:20:30  <sdague> which is the longer tradgey of the commons of the gate
2014-06-11T20:20:45  <sdague> asside done
2014-06-11T20:20:52  <lifeless> sdague: yep, and we have the same small-group, quick dropoff pattern visible within tripleo specific jobs

2014-06-11T20:23:31  <foobio> superbee: lemme take a tally on our cinder utilization in that account...
2014-06-11T20:23:33  <lifeless> sdague: if we can capture something pcrews can go and hack on, I rather suspect he will :)
2014-06-11T20:23:36  <superbee> foobio: thanks
2014-06-11T20:24:02  <sdague> 1) create a new tag in the queries files that says this is part of: 'foo'
2014-06-11T20:24:35  *** cody-somerville has joined #openstack-infra
2014-06-11T20:24:36  <sdague> and if it's part of anything, we exclude it from the main graphs that we have, and make it basically a seperate namespace for the dashboards
2014-06-11T20:24:42  <superbee> foobio: I just recheck experimental'd a config change to see if the zuul swift stuff will work
2014-06-11T20:24:47  <superbee> foobio: I am very excited about this too :)
2014-06-11T20:25:00  <sdague> actually, that's probably a better idea than the other ideas I've got
2014-06-11T20:25:06  <lifeless> ok
2014-06-11T20:25:10  <sdague> basically create namespaces within er
2014-06-11T20:25:25  <lifeless> pcrews: https://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/elastic-recheck is the codebase in question
2014-06-11T20:25:32  <sdague> then tripleo can be a namespace, which includes a full set of dashboards that we have now
2014-06-11T20:25:59  <lifeless> pcrews: http://status.openstack.org/elastic-recheck/ is the deployed thing
2014-06-11T20:26:02  <sdague> the dashboards are a little adhoc, appologies for the organic there, so we might need to poke a bit on the right way to do that
2014-06-11T20:26:41  <foobio> superbee: yeah, we're using 23.1tb of our 25tb quota, so we could spare a 300gb volume for each of the 6 es nodes, but after that we're basically tapped out without either moving logs to swift or asking for another quota bump
2014-06-11T20:26:50  <pcrews> lifeless: ack - I've been reading up on that system a bit out of personal interest :)
2014-06-11T20:27:22  <superbee> foobio: ok, we already bumped that quota right?
2014-06-11T20:27:25  <pcrews> our group was working on similar-ish stuff for MySQL way back when...fun stuff
2014-06-11T20:27:35  <sdague> pcrews: cool :)
2014-06-11T20:27:42  <foobio> superbee: yeah, it was originally at 10tb and we asked them to up it to 25tb
2014-06-11T20:27:50  <superbee> foobio: I don't expect the logs stuff to be a magical overnight cure as we won't migrate the data
2014-06-11T20:27:54  <lifeless> pcrews: so, if you can get what sdague has described working, it will allow tripleo and ironic to use e-r which will be cool
2014-06-11T20:27:59  <superbee> foobio: we may need to ask for more quota in the interim
2014-06-11T20:28:02  <lifeless> sdague: do you want a spec, or just pcrews patches ?
2014-06-11T20:28:41  <sdague> It's probably worth an etherpad to sketch out
2014-06-11T20:28:45  <lifeless> sdague: are there any special tricks to hacking on this? like, do you need local elasticsearch infrastructure, or you can use the deployed api endpoints?
2014-06-11T20:28:50  <sdague> but I'm ok with patches as well
2014-06-11T20:29:01  <lifeless> http://etherpad.openstack.org/p/elastic-recheck-namespace
2014-06-11T20:29:19  <sdague> you can use the deployed endpoint
2014-06-11T20:29:22  <superbee> sdague: of course as soon as I say it is catching up it slows down and backs up a bit :(
2014-06-11T20:29:27  <sdague> superbee: oom?
2014-06-11T20:29:37  <superbee> sdague: no just normal activity I think
2014-06-11T20:29:39  <sdague> ok
2014-06-11T20:29:45  <sdague> well the slope was good
2014-06-11T20:29:51  <sdague> hopefully it keeps up on it
2014-06-11T20:29:53  <superbee> yeah I think we are hitting a local disturbance in the force
2014-06-11T20:29:56  <superbee> but we will see
2014-06-11T20:30:06  <sdague> superbee: gate reset?
2014-06-11T20:30:17  <sdague> yeh, we just reset

2014-06-11T20:34:01  <lifeless> we can't today run tripleo jobs in the main infrastructure because you can't pretend to be baremetal with any fidelity in public clouds
2014-06-11T20:34:01  <sdague> so this also relates to the fact that you don't run tempest yet
2014-06-11T20:34:07  <lifeless> it does
2014-06-11T20:34:13  <lifeless> we have a patchset up to do that
2014-06-11T20:34:20  <lifeless> andrea within HP is working on that
2014-06-11T20:34:29  <sdague> because I think your swing of races in openstack vs. infra flakey is going to dramatically change after that
2014-06-11T20:34:35  <lifeless> we need to run tempest in three different configurations
2014-06-11T20:34:54  <lifeless> a) against the seed, b) against the undercloud, c) against a deployed overcloud
2014-06-11T20:34:58  <lifeless> thats one dimension
2014-06-11T20:35:17  <lifeless> as we add more configurations that folk deploy, we'll build a matrix, which I know you're familiar with :)

2014-06-11T20:35:35  <sdague> sure

2014-06-11T20:35:53  <sdague> lifeless: is that a sequence, or are you running a, b, c as parallel

2014-06-11T20:36:29  <sdague> pcrews: cool :)
2014-06-11T20:36:33  <lifeless> so we have two immediate uses for ER
2014-06-11T20:36:46  <superbee> pcrews: be careful going outside today. The weather is too nice for seattle
2014-06-11T20:36:59  *** vhoward has joined #openstack-infra
2014-06-11T20:37:05  <lifeless> one is to help derekh and me and pcrews and others who are focused on CI prioritise what we need to fix to fix these infrastructury things
2014-06-11T20:37:24  <lifeless> which sometimes will be making openstack code more robust and sometimes bringing new services into the CI environment - you know the drill
2014-06-11T20:37:31  <sdague> yep
2014-06-11T20:37:39  <lifeless> the second thing is that we want to *avoid* folk recheck no bugging jobs
2014-06-11T20:37:50  <lifeless> its wasteful, they should only recheck if its really spurious
2014-06-11T20:37:51  <sdague> sure, that's fair.
2014-06-11T20:38:21  <sdague> especially as I think today a recheck is retriggering the jenkins nodes as well
2014-06-11T20:38:36  <sdague> for the jobs that live in both check queues

2014-06-11T20:39:08  <pcrews> superbee: I still feel rather leery daring to go too far outside w/o some sort of jacket :)
2014-06-11T20:39:12  <lifeless> but I can answer them now - we have 10 times as many open reviews as reviewers, and reviewers don't have the time or patience to be reasoned with over test failures

2014-06-11T20:59:35  <sdague> I think that's part of the challenge of devtest being different than devstack, is there is currently a parallel universe of setup which has thusfar prevented the tripleo team from getting as far as tempest
2014-06-11T21:00:19  <lifeless> the problem there is that devstack is an installer, devtest is a meta-installer - it installs an installer, not a cloud
2014-06-11T21:00:51  <sdague> yeh, well people have extended devstack to do all kinds of things at this point
2014-06-11T21:01:08  *** cody-somerville has quit IRC
2014-06-11T21:01:20  <sdague> and maybe these things have to stay parallel universes
2014-06-11T21:02:14  <sdague> but there are definitely things lost in that fact, like expertise with tempest, as that's something which is setup by default ready to run at the end of devstack
2014-06-11T21:02:36  <sdague> anyway, this is the meta conversation

2014-06-11T22:04:03  <mordred> like, would that be the right way to get json log data? and/or should we just add a fluentd output module for oslo.log and spit things directly?
2014-06-11T22:04:05  <superbee> but I haven't actually looked to see if that works
2014-06-11T22:04:08  <mordred> neat

2014-06-11T22:04:43  <superbee> but json should also make manipulation for human display easier too

2014-06-11T22:07:27  <superbee> but I don't think we change the decoupled logging for tests that we have today
2014-06-11T22:07:36  <superbee> instead we have the tests dump json lines to files
2014-06-11T22:07:55  <superbee> then pick them up afterwards and shove them into fluentd so the python-json-logger is a better approach
