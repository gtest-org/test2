2014-09-06T02:52:34  <anteaya> haven't bought them in a long time, had to buy them on wednesday
2014-09-06T02:52:54  <anteaya> after I woke up from passing out after the dentist, I couldn't stop eating them
2014-09-06T02:53:10  <anteaya> got to a health food store today, couldn't put the postassium down
2014-09-06T02:53:28  <anteaya> I keep checking every hour or so to see if I need more and I am finally leveling off
2014-09-06T02:53:59  <anteaya> and I no longer have a black hole in my chest so yay
2014-09-06T02:54:28  <anteaya> the dentist anasthetic was the catalyst but not the cause
2014-09-06T02:54:49  <anteaya> I still hate my neighbours
2014-09-06T02:55:00  <anteaya> but my heart is mine again
2014-09-06T02:55:22  <annegentle> yikes anteaya glad you figured it out. I didn't realize that about potassium
2014-09-06T02:55:51  <anteaya> annegentle: thanks, neither did I, I have never been low on it before
2014-09-06T02:56:14  <anteaya> read up on it, releasing stress hormones lowers your potassium
2014-09-06T02:56:21  <annegentle> I thought low levels caused leg cramps, but I guess the heart is half electrical half physical/flow vales and stuff

2014-09-06T02:56:40  <anteaya> low levels of magnesium causes leg cramps

2014-09-06T02:57:04  <anteaya> nerves are sodium/potassium
2014-09-06T02:57:30  <anteaya> high altitudes cause leg cramps too, learned that this summer as well
2014-09-06T02:57:35  <annegentle> oww
2014-09-06T02:57:38  *** praneshp has joined #openstack-infra
2014-09-06T02:57:45  <anteaya> so magnesium at high altitudes
2014-09-06T02:58:10  <anteaya> my normal stress routine is vitamin b and dha as much as I can take
2014-09-06T02:58:18  <anteaya> now I'll be sure to add potassium as well
2014-09-06T02:58:57  <annegentle> reminds me to take my calcium
2014-09-06T02:59:20  <anteaya> always good to take your calcium

2014-09-06T18:19:20  <wenlock> hi, is anyone using gertty with two gerrit servers?  when i start my second gertty with my second gerrit server it seems to try to pull down repos from the first server that im subscribed to, then errors out.  wondering if this is working yet.

2014-09-06T18:30:40  *** yamamoto has joined #openstack-infra
2014-09-06T18:30:42  <mordred> ekarlso-: no
2014-09-06T18:30:54  <mordred> ekarlso-: I mean, you can use any test runner you want to, actually
2014-09-06T18:31:00  *** ZZelle_ has joined #openstack-infra
2014-09-06T18:31:01  <wenlock> mordred, yeah that would work to
2014-09-06T18:31:12  <ekarlso-> mordred: how you avoid the .testrepository corruptness then between py versions ?
2014-09-06T18:31:29  <mordred> ekarlso-: I don't - but I'm hoping that lifeless will fix that soon
2014-09-06T18:31:32  <mordred> it's just a bug
2014-09-06T18:32:08  <mordred> ekarlso-: what happened is that the default backend for dbm changed between 2.6 and 2.7, aiui
2014-09-06T18:32:20  <wenlock> mordred , if i drill into a log file, any tricks on getting out of it?
2014-09-06T18:32:24  <jroll> ekarlso-: just make your test command: rm -rf .testrepository && testr init && testr run... :P
2014-09-06T18:32:31  <mordred> jroll: :)
2014-09-06T18:32:42  <ekarlso-> jroll: +1

2014-09-06T18:57:34  <mordred> dstufft: did you happen to see that things did not go as well as we might want there ^^
2014-09-06T18:58:40  <mordred> dstufft: specifically, if you follow the log (search for pbr from the top) you'll see we install pbr from tip of our git repo which installs 0.11.0.dev17.g4cecec5
2014-09-06T18:59:09  <mordred> dstufft: then, for some reason, when we install cliff, this happens: http://logs.openstack.org/86/119486/2/check/check-tempest-dsvm-full/181b646/logs/devstacklog.txt.gz#_2014-09-05_22_04_22_075
2014-09-06T18:59:25  <mordred> "Installed /tmp/pip-owgFlV-build/pbr-0.10.0-py2.7.egg"
2014-09-06T19:00:23  <mordred> I checked cliff, and it _Does_ setup requires on pbr, but does not declare a version on it
2014-09-06T19:00:31  <mordred> which is what we expect
2014-09-06T19:00:35  <mordred> 0.10.0 is what's on pypi
2014-09-06T19:01:40  <mordred> so it seems that, for some reason, setuptools does not consider that any version of pbr is installed, even though 0.11.0.dev17.g4cecec5 is installed, and instead downloads the latest from pypi?
2014-09-06T19:02:07  <mordred> but then this: http://logs.openstack.org/86/119486/2/check/check-tempest-dsvm-full/181b646/logs/devstacklog.txt.gz#_2014-09-05_22_04_57_272

2014-09-06T23:38:55  <mordred> lifeless: yah. I agree, transactions are bonghits in this case - "consistent" I believe means "file format that does not change in confusing ways from python version to python version"
2014-09-06T23:39:23  <jroll> ^^

2014-09-06T23:39:47  <jroll> more like "does not care about python"

2014-09-06T23:41:13  <mordred> foobio, superbee: ok. I've got the as-yet-unlanded ansible nova inventory collecting and adding cinder volume info
2014-09-06T23:41:40  <mordred> and have it consistently doing the thing we were trying to do with the new mirror servesr ... AND, pulling the mount point out of the metadata
2014-09-06T23:41:43  <mordred> and it works on hp and rackspace

2014-09-06T23:44:58  <mordred> you can see there the cinder_volumes entry in the metadata for pypi.iad.openstack.org
2014-09-06T23:45:19  <mordred> and taht in the attachments section, it shows the device name
2014-09-06T23:47:00  <lifeless> jroll: right - so that would be great. but tbh openstack just uses testr weirdly: its a metarunner, not a runner - it should be running tox, not vice versa - and that way it wouldn't be run under N different pythons in one dir
2014-09-06T23:47:53  <lifeless> anyhow, tis sunday, ciao :)
2014-09-06T23:49:18  <mordred> the trick in scripting, it turns out, is to run the call to attach the volume, and then do a poll loop checking for the attachment data to show up

2014-09-06T23:49:21  <jroll> lifeless: touché
2014-09-06T23:50:02  <mordred> lifeless: indeed, although that would be weird for other reasons (tox is the entry point to things other than tests)
2014-09-06T23:50:06  <mordred> lifeless: but enjoy sunday!
