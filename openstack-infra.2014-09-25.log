2014-09-25T00:01:15  <nibalizer> i don tthing thats right. I think $config_dir = '/etc/project-config' ; require => Vcsrepo[$config_dir] is right though
2014-09-25T00:01:27  <foobio> it's freeze-time
2014-09-25T00:01:36  <superbee> nibalizer: that requires yo uto use vcsrepo...
2014-09-25T00:01:47  <superbee> nibalizer: which isn't good parameterization imo
2014-09-25T00:01:50  <foobio> looks like we have three patches in the gate and one more which could use a last-minute +3
2014-09-25T00:02:09  <nibalizer> if jbooboo confirms that his way works then all good
2014-09-25T00:02:15  <jbooboo> seems to! :)
2014-09-25T00:02:17  <nibalizer> im pretty wiped out from puppetconf at this point
2014-09-25T00:02:30  <nibalizer> okay lets do that then!

2014-09-25T00:03:08  <jogo> superbee: is the logstash config stuff frozen in the big config repo re-org right now?
2014-09-25T00:03:15  <superbee> jogo: it should be
2014-09-25T00:03:26  <superbee> jogo: but all of it may not be because some of it is templatized
2014-09-25T00:03:32  <superbee> jogo: we should treat it as frozen
2014-09-25T00:03:53  <foobio> jogo: superbee: logstash changes? i think we didn't put any of the logstash configuration up on the block for project-config
2014-09-25T00:04:17  <foobio> at least i skipped the logstash configuration changes because it looked like they weren't involved
2014-09-25T00:04:42  <jogo> superbee foobio: ask because we are not parsing %{logmessage}

2014-09-25T00:05:32  <jogo> superbee: right. so i was thinking filing a tripleo bug and removing that from logstash for now
2014-09-25T00:05:39  <jogo> after consulting with tripleo folks first
2014-09-25T00:06:02  <superbee> jogo: can we do it when we are less frozen? I mostly don't want to inadverdently break things (this is why we are frozen)
2014-09-25T00:06:02  <stevemar> i guess i can't issue a tox command in a jenkins job :(
2014-09-25T00:06:30  <superbee> stevemar: the majority of our jobs issue tox commands. do you have a log to where doing so is breaking?
2014-09-25T00:06:32  <jogo> superbee: yes we can do this when things are less frozen, that is why I asked
2014-09-25T00:06:39  <superbee> jogo: ok

2014-09-25T00:44:02  <jogo> superbee: those are half the size
2014-09-25T00:44:04  <jogo> 211k
2014-09-25T00:44:13  <jogo> devstacklog.txt.gz that is
2014-09-25T00:44:17  <jbooboo> anteaya: what do you mean?
2014-09-25T00:45:08  <anteaya> jbooboo: just trying to figure out where stevebaker's question fits in
2014-09-25T00:45:46  <jbooboo> oh. yep.  frozen.
2014-09-25T00:45:52  <anteaya> thanks
2014-09-25T00:45:52  <jbooboo> stevebaker: is that a broken, voting job?
2014-09-25T00:46:00  <superbee> I said possibly because there was no change yet
2014-09-25T00:46:05  <superbee> and it depends on when the fix comes in
2014-09-25T00:46:12  <stevebaker> jbooboo: no, a new job which is yet to work
2014-09-25T00:46:33  <jbooboo> stevebaker: then yeah, it'll have to wait, sorry
2014-09-25T00:47:06  <stevebaker> I'll propose a WIP anyway. Is there a new projects repo yet?
2014-09-25T00:47:28  <jbooboo> stevebaker: no, we can't actually create it for several more hours
2014-09-25T00:47:39  <stevebaker> ok, np
2014-09-25T00:47:45  <foobio> basically the reason for the freeze
2014-09-25T00:47:47  <anteaya> we have to wait for final patches to merge
2014-09-25T00:47:49  <jbooboo> ya

2014-09-25T00:48:33  <jbooboo> so, unfortunately, we're probably behind a 710-deep merge-check queue
2014-09-25T00:48:41  <anteaya> wooooo
2014-09-25T00:48:52  * krotscheck breaks out the movies and the popcorn.
2014-09-25T00:48:52  <foobio> and we approved them just as we hit the largest spike of merge-check jobs of the day launched, yeah
2014-09-25T00:49:00  <jbooboo> anteaya: i would recommend that walk :)

2014-09-25T00:49:22  <foobio> i am personally taking this as an opportunity to wash dishes
2014-09-25T00:49:32  <anteaya> I can do a one hour, hour and a half or a two hour walk
2014-09-25T00:49:34  <foobio> though i like superbee's idea far better

2014-09-25T00:50:12  <jbooboo> anteaya: best guess: 1hr
2014-09-25T00:50:14  <anteaya> I'd like to do the most I can, I didn't get any in today but don't want to keep folks waiting on me
2014-09-25T00:50:17  <anteaya> very good
2014-09-25T00:50:24  * anteaya gets shoes and coat
2014-09-25T00:50:26  <superbee> foobio: if you can get them an IPAs made by breakside and gigantic are amazing
2014-09-25T00:50:27  <jbooboo> anteaya: also, i don't think you need to stay up for this
2014-09-25T00:50:38  <jogo> superbee: for fun https://review.openstack.org/#/c/121914/ makes nova unit tests log pretty big too
2014-09-25T00:50:38  <jbooboo> anteaya: if you want to do the repo split/import tomorrow morning i think that will be fine
2014-09-25T00:50:38  <superbee> also omsi after dark is tonight but I am missing it (have to go to seattle tomorrow and pack)
2014-09-25T00:50:43  <jbooboo> anteaya: whatever works for you
2014-09-25T00:50:48  <foobio> superbee: yeah, had them when visiting the west coast. haven't seen either here much
2014-09-25T00:50:48  <anteaya> jbooboo: I will check in once I get back from my walk
2014-09-25T00:50:54  <jbooboo> anteaya: ok
2014-09-25T00:50:55  <anteaya> thanks
2014-09-25T00:50:55  <jogo> console for that is now 291k whee
2014-09-25T00:51:03  <superbee> so I don't know why pretty tox is a thing
2014-09-25T00:51:05  <superbee> I personally hate it

2014-09-25T00:51:36  <foobio> it does feel like people optimizing for a very bad workflow

2014-09-25T00:53:40  * jbooboo stops watching the merge-queue counter
2014-09-25T00:53:41  <superbee> super awesome
2014-09-25T00:54:08  <foobio> superbee: looks awesome
2014-09-25T00:54:29  <foobio> oh, that reminds me, i did end up hitting brewfest on my way back from oscon
2014-09-25T00:54:37  <superbee> foobio: nice
2014-09-25T00:54:49  <superbee> foobio: I really wish they did it a bit more beer garden style
2014-09-25T00:55:04  <superbee> but it has grown to giant size and they do their best I guess
2014-09-25T00:55:31  <superbee> I didn't bother with any samplers when I went. the lines were too long so I just pciekd beers that looked good and got full glasses
2014-09-25T00:55:51  *** lcheng has joined #openstack-infra
2014-09-25T00:56:01  <foobio> i had a saturday evening flight, so slept in, was heading toward the airport on the max, decided to stop off and check out the park, noticed there was beer, went in and ate and drank for several hours, got back on the max and headed the rest of the rest of the way to pdx
2014-09-25T00:56:08  <foobio> it was one of those happy accidents
2014-09-25T00:56:36  <superbee> we enforced a time limit so as not to over do it :)
2014-09-25T00:56:36  <foobio> i did do samplers because i had a ton of time to kill
2014-09-25T00:56:58  <foobio> so standing in line wasn't a problem
2014-09-25T00:57:06  *** homeless has quit IRC
2014-09-25T00:57:41  <superbee> the best part was when we had to a sign all kinds of paperwork to get a minor in
2014-09-25T00:57:49  <superbee> they advertise being minor friendly then make it such a pita
2014-09-25T00:57:51  <foobio> also, the starter pack of tokens all spent on samplers was plenty enough beer to prep me for an afternoon in the airport followed by an overnight cross-country flight
2014-09-25T00:59:21  <foobio> since they were usually overshooting the sample line on the glass, i'm sure i had ~6 pints, a lot of it high-gravity brews
2014-09-25T01:00:05  <superbee> ya I think most of the pourers are volunteers with OLCC licenses so they are generous

2014-09-25T01:22:41  <openstackgerrit> Ian Wienand proposed a change to openstack-infra/nodepool: Add meta option for passing meta-data  https://review.openstack.org/123639
2014-09-25T01:22:42  <superbee> then once those are moved to the regular node label I would set up rax with the -dib label and test those too
2014-09-25T01:22:52  <superbee> basically make sure ^ is working like we expect it
2014-09-25T01:22:55  *** stevemar has quit IRC
2014-09-25T01:22:58  <superbee> and that rax is generally happy with the image(s)
2014-09-25T01:23:04  <foobio> i guess it's a question of whether we want to push forward building images different ways in two providers, or wait until we can reasonably switch in both
2014-09-25T01:23:24  *** stevemar has joined #openstack-infra
2014-09-25T01:23:28  <superbee> foobio: I am not too worried about that because status quo is different images today
2014-09-25T01:23:39  *** bdpayne has quit IRC
2014-09-25T01:23:46  <foobio> true, but at least relatively similar methods of assembling them
2014-09-25T01:24:57  <jbooboo> superbee: if i were going to be around next week, i'd say i'd be okay with doing hp in dib while we work on rax
2014-09-25T01:25:11  <jbooboo> but i'm not likely to have to deal with the consequences of that, so i'll abstain :)

2014-09-25T01:28:26  <openstackgerrit> Matt Riedemann proposed a change to openstack-infra/elastic-recheck: Add query for keystone bug 1373680  https://review.openstack.org/123910
2014-09-25T01:28:28  <uvirtbot> Launchpad bug 1373680 in keystone "keystone fails to start on icehouse side of grenade, "error: [Errno 98] Address already in use"" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1373680
2014-09-25T01:28:30  <superbee> I think the big win here is reducing the large number of image builds (save cpu time) and moving to a more consistent base. Even if we start doing that in small chunks that is worthwhile
2014-09-25T01:29:19  <foobio> i see making the images we test on downloadable as a huge win. i know that's the step-3-profit part but still

2014-09-25T02:09:51  <openstackgerrit> A change was merged to openstack-infra/config: Project may now be assigned to multiple project groups.  https://review.openstack.org/111815
2014-09-25T02:10:02  <jbooboo> 122199 aprvd
2014-09-25T02:10:10  <superbee> wait I am expected to be up and about?
2014-09-25T02:10:30  <foobio> out of curiosity, was there a plan to address the chicken-and-egg situation 121650 presents?
2014-09-25T02:10:52  <anteaya> do expand on the chicken and egg situation you are thinking of
2014-09-25T02:10:58  <jbooboo> reviewing that now
2014-09-25T02:10:59  <foobio> presumably we'll need to propose a copy of that change to the new repo once it's created
2014-09-25T02:10:59  *** cnesa13 has quit IRC
2014-09-25T02:11:15  <jbooboo> foobio: yeah, we should
2014-09-25T02:11:18  <superbee> foobio: I had not considered that, but yes
2014-09-25T02:11:22  <foobio> since it won't be included in the filtered repo it's importing
2014-09-25T02:12:00  <anteaya> foobio: I'm slow, try me again?
2014-09-25T02:12:31  <anteaya> so a backport to project-config
2014-09-25T02:12:36  <foobio> anteaya: 121650 uses the filtered repo to seed openstack-infra/project-config
2014-09-25T02:12:40  <anteaya> for the create the project-config repo?
2014-09-25T02:12:48  <anteaya> yes
2014-09-25T02:12:49  <superbee> the first chane tp project-config should be a copy of 121650
2014-09-25T02:12:57  <anteaya> interesting
2014-09-25T02:13:04  <foobio> but the filtered repo has already been created from a state of openstack-infra/config from before 121650 was merged
2014-09-25T02:13:05  <superbee> or maybe gitreview things first if necessary
2014-09-25T02:13:08  <superbee> then 121650
2014-09-25T02:13:10  * anteaya does inception brain for a minute
2014-09-25T02:13:12  <foobio> so it needs a copy of that change
2014-09-25T02:13:18  *** dannywilson has quit IRC
2014-09-25T02:13:42  <foobio> yeah, gitreview edits can either be squashed with that or the change prior to it
2014-09-25T02:13:48  <superbee> oh jbooboo just -1'd as I +2'd
2014-09-25T02:13:49  <jbooboo> anteaya, foobio: left comments on 121650, i think it will need some work
2014-09-25T02:13:57  <anteaya> oh okay
2014-09-25T02:14:13  <superbee> jbooboo: don't we want the puppet integration test tests?
2014-09-25T02:14:15  *** boden has joined #openstack-infra
2014-09-25T02:14:18  <jbooboo> also, those jobs that remain will likely fail, but we can probably work an a monolithic commit to fix them
2014-09-25T02:14:21  *** emagana has quit IRC
2014-09-25T02:14:21  <anteaya> 8 comments
2014-09-25T02:14:26  <jbooboo> superbee: there's no puppet in that repo
2014-09-25T02:14:37  *** jpich has joined #openstack-infra
2014-09-25T02:14:38  <superbee> jbooboo: right but the /config repo depends on those files
2014-09-25T02:14:49  *** emagana has joined #openstack-infra
2014-09-25T02:14:58  <foobio> i assumed they were going to be treated as integration jobs
2014-09-25T02:15:09  <superbee> so this would be more of a make sure that deleting a thing doesn't break us? though the tests are probably not able to test that effectively
2014-09-25T02:15:14  <foobio> also there is one python script in the new repo i think, though i'm ambivalent about style checking it
2014-09-25T02:15:28  <jbooboo> superbee: but the apply test is --noop
2014-09-25T02:15:37  <anteaya> there is more than one python script now
2014-09-25T02:15:46  <anteaya> since we added 5 files from tools/
2014-09-25T02:15:47  <superbee> jbooboo: oh right, ya so I think the test isn't able to test that effectively
2014-09-25T02:16:01  <jbooboo> anteaya: ok, we can keep pep8 then

2014-09-25T02:16:43  *** dimtruck is now known as zz_dimtruck
2014-09-25T02:16:50  <jbooboo> superbee: it's possible this could break the apply tests.  what we probably should do is actually execute the project_config puppet class at the beginning of the integration test
2014-09-25T02:16:58  *** thedodd has joined #openstack-infra
2014-09-25T02:17:12  <jbooboo> superbee: then do include the project_config repo in the integration test
2014-09-25T02:17:20  *** marun has quit IRC
2014-09-25T02:17:27  <superbee> jbooboo: execute it without --noop?
2014-09-25T02:17:28  <jbooboo> then i think we will effectively test that
2014-09-25T02:17:40  <jbooboo> superbee: yep.  like "puppet apply class {...}"
2014-09-25T02:17:41  <superbee> that seems like a reasonable approach
2014-09-25T02:17:52  <foobio> ahh, yep
2014-09-25T02:18:12  <openstackgerrit> A change was merged to openstack-infra/config: Removes redundant jobs from config gate and check  https://review.openstack.org/122199
2014-09-25T02:18:22  <jbooboo> but we can do that all tomorrow; i think we'll actually have quite a bit of work buliding these tests up again
2014-09-25T02:18:32  <jbooboo> (that's what i'm planning on spending most of the day doing)
2014-09-25T02:18:32  <superbee> wfm
2014-09-25T02:18:33  <foobio> quite probably so, yes

2014-09-25T02:20:32  <foobio> jbooboo: i figured. hopefully it'll all be working and i won't instead discover a dozen new bugs we've merged this afternoon

2014-09-25T02:20:59  <foobio> which i am fully bracing myself for being a possibility

2014-09-25T02:29:09  <anteaya> thanks
2014-09-25T02:29:10  <superbee> the groups thing was addressed
2014-09-25T02:29:24  <anteaya> jbooboo: what did I miss?
2014-09-25T02:29:32  <jbooboo> anteaya: we need to change the job names for three jobs; but those will require jjb changes
2014-09-25T02:29:47  <anteaya> can I do that now?
2014-09-25T02:30:05  <anteaya> I would much rather work tonight when it is quiet
2014-09-25T02:30:09  <foobio> wow, "openstack foundation" made stackalytics' top-ten list of reviews by company
2014-09-25T02:30:19  <anteaya> ha ha ha
2014-09-25T02:30:22  <anteaya> go foobio
2014-09-25T02:30:24  <jbooboo> anteaya: we could continue to do that in 121650, or we could punt and do those in another change (though we would also need to re-propose that to the new repo)
2014-09-25T02:30:41  <anteaya> your call
2014-09-25T02:30:47  <anteaya> doesn't matter to me
2014-09-25T02:30:59  <superbee> are they not templated?
2014-09-25T02:31:19  <jbooboo> superbee: these are the special one-offs
2014-09-25T02:31:26  <jbooboo> it might just be a matter of changing their names
2014-09-25T02:31:28  <foobio> poop. i was ranked #12
2014-09-25T02:31:34  * foobio is slacking
2014-09-25T02:31:36  <anteaya> foobio: who beat you?
2014-09-25T02:31:45  <anteaya> 12 from the foundation?
2014-09-25T02:31:52  <anteaya> who are the other 11?
2014-09-25T02:32:00  <anteaya> and where are they hiding?
2014-09-25T02:32:03  <foobio> anteaya: no, i'm #12 on the reviews by engineer list
2014-09-25T02:32:07  <anteaya> oh well
2014-09-25T02:32:12  <anteaya> SergeyLukjanov never sleeps

2014-09-25T02:33:51  <anteaya> it is almost like they have to write a lot of lines of code
2014-09-25T02:33:58  <jbooboo> anteaya, superbee, foobio: for 121650 i think any of these options would be okay:
2014-09-25T02:34:30  <jbooboo> a) ignore the names of the jobs for now because it's probably not important anyway; b) drop the jobs and add them back later; c) changes the names in 121650
2014-09-25T02:34:52  <superbee> I think I prefer b to a and c would be best but is more work
2014-09-25T02:35:03  <superbee> so I will say b

2014-09-25T03:10:21  <jeffrey4l> hey guys, could anybody explain this "The config repo is frozen. Please stop offering patches. These files won't be in config once we are done the work." ? What's means by *frozen*.
2014-09-25T03:10:27  <anteaya> there you are
2014-09-25T03:10:34  *** thedodd has quit IRC
2014-09-25T03:10:36  <anteaya> was wondering how long it would take you to read that
2014-09-25T03:10:41  <anteaya> was about to head off to bed
2014-09-25T03:10:49  <anteaya> yeah the config repo is frozen
2014-09-25T03:10:58  <anteaya> please stop offering patches
2014-09-25T03:11:02  <jeffrey4l> what's the reason?
2014-09-25T03:11:14  <anteaya> we are implimenting this spec: http://specs.openstack.org/openstack-infra/infra-specs/specs/config-repo-split.html
2014-09-25T03:11:50  <anteaya> here is the annoucement email: http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2014-September/046904.html
2014-09-25T03:12:10  <anteaya> the changes you want will need to be offered to project-config once it is in gerrit
2014-09-25T03:12:14  <anteaya> which it isn't yet
2014-09-25T03:12:25  <jeffrey4l> ok. Got it.
2014-09-25T03:12:41  <anteaya> and if you clone if from github and work on it from there you are just wasting your time
2014-09-25T03:12:41  *** dane_leblanc has quit IRC
2014-09-25T03:12:48  <anteaya> we should be done tomorrow
2014-09-25T03:13:07  <jeffrey4l> Understand. Thanks for you information.
2014-09-25T03:13:11  <anteaya> np
2014-09-25T03:13:18  <anteaya> so save your energy
2014-09-25T03:13:28  <anteaya> and offer the patches to project-config tomorrow
2014-09-25T03:13:38  <anteaya> good night
2014-09-25T03:13:43  * anteaya heads off to bed

2014-09-25T13:40:27  <foobio> AJaeger: the imported repo is just the result of a git filter-branch run so the original file path will match the source copy in the config repo, but then there will be a huge change full of git mv calls
2014-09-25T13:40:56  <AJaeger> foobio, fine with me ;) Thanks for the heads-up. I missed that somehow.
2014-09-25T13:41:02  <AJaeger> I like this ;)
2014-09-25T13:41:48  <foobio> the end goal is to have a much saner organized/structured set of data files which doesn't really have anything to do with puppet

2014-09-25T14:54:24  <anteaya> what did we decide is the first patch that project-config needs
2014-09-25T14:54:38  <sdague> superbee: can we drop lines that don't time parse in logstash instead of making up their time as parse time?
2014-09-25T14:54:43  <anteaya> sdake: config is frozen, we have split it out

2014-09-25T14:55:30  <anteaya> sdake: best to wait a few hours
2014-09-25T14:55:36  <superbee> sdague we can drop them sure. I dont understand why we would do that
2014-09-25T14:55:52  <sdague> because they mostly confuse the issue
2014-09-25T14:56:00  <superbee> sdague its better to handle parse failures gracefully imo
2014-09-25T14:56:04  <superbee> what issue?
2014-09-25T14:56:15  <anteaya> I think the .gitreview patch is first
2014-09-25T14:56:23  <sdague> so lets take - http://logstash.openstack.org/#eyJzZWFyY2giOiIiLCJmaWVsZHMiOltdLCJvZmZzZXQiOjAsInRpbWVmcmFtZSI6OTAwLCJncmFwaG1vZGUiOiJjb3VudCJ9
2014-09-25T14:56:34  <superbee> dropping on the floor is going to make debugging hard impossible hard
2014-09-25T14:56:35  <sdague> which is just the front page
2014-09-25T14:57:02  <sdague> superbee: what is the value of - "container-server: Started child 2197"
2014-09-25T14:57:17  <sdague> that has a time that's completely unrelated to when that message was created
2014-09-25T14:57:26  <superbee> sdague the value is its there if I have to debug why it failed

2014-09-25T15:02:15  <superbee> thats not the point. the point is if its jumbled there you can debug it

2014-09-25T15:02:33  <superbee> just that its not there

2014-09-25T15:06:12  <superbee> I am more open to that because we can specifically identifu issues in those cases
2014-09-25T15:06:27  <sdague> it's not actually that our logs are bad
2014-09-25T15:06:44  <sdague> it's actually that stuff is printing to screen
2014-09-25T15:06:58  <sdague> remember, the logs we capture, aren't actually logs, they are screen sessions
2014-09-25T15:07:01  <superbee> no in this case its swift being bad
2014-09-25T15:07:26  <sdague> really? I though that was a pre log handler setup print
2014-09-25T15:07:28  <superbee> screen session logging goes through python logging and can/should have timestamps like all loggong
2014-09-25T15:07:43  <superbee> sdague nope I already match and drop that

2014-09-25T15:59:17  <anteaya> dhellmann: fair enough, well they are disabled now so at least we will have some quiet from them
2014-09-25T15:59:33  <jbooboo> especially in socal, they're probably surfing

2014-09-25T15:59:50  <anteaya> surfing would be good
2014-09-25T15:59:51  <foobio> fwiw their lp profile seems to be set to private because i can't look them up through the api reversing their openid url
2014-09-25T15:59:54  <anteaya> I have never surfed
2014-09-25T16:00:03  <anteaya> that is odd
2014-09-25T16:00:26  <anteaya> jbooboo: what else can I do now to keep us moving along?
2014-09-25T16:01:04  <anteaya> should I submit the back port of https://review.openstack.org/#/c/121650/ as a dependency to the reorg patch?
2014-09-25T16:01:37  <jbooboo> anteaya: good one; ++
2014-09-25T16:01:40  <anteaya> kk
2014-09-25T16:02:00  <foobio> anteaya: you'd probably need to insert it between 124087 and its parent, or else move the files around to match in your backport
2014-09-25T16:02:20  <foobio> (though git might be smart enough to figure it out from the mv info)

2014-09-25T16:04:02  <mdbooth> At some point in the past, when you told jenkins to recheck it would post a comment about having queued a job, and remove its -1
2014-09-25T16:04:10  <mdbooth> It doesn't seem to be doing that now
2014-09-25T16:04:14  <mdbooth> Is that intentional?

2014-09-25T16:05:44  <superbee> jbooboo something like skipsdist = true
2014-09-25T16:05:44  <foobio> mdbooth: yes, that was unfortunate noise we had to bear due to shortcomings in older versions of gerrit. we've since managed to upgrade and have turned that behavior back off

2014-09-25T16:06:27  <openstackgerrit> Matt Riedemann proposed a change to openstack-infra/elastic-recheck: Add query for heat security group race bug 1374021  https://review.openstack.org/124094
2014-09-25T16:06:28  <uvirtbot> Launchpad bug 1374021 in heat "test_server_cfn_init in check-tempest-dsvm-neutron-heat-slow fails with "BadRequest: Security group default already exists for project"" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1374021
2014-09-25T16:06:42  <mdbooth> The reason is that when I've submitted a lot of changes, I will get a lot of failures
2014-09-25T16:07:05  <foobio> anteaya: i've gone over the resulting tree in a checkout of 124087 and it looks perfect
2014-09-25T16:07:06  <mdbooth> When Jenkins removed its -1/-2 after kicking off a job, it was really easy for me to see which ones I'd already done
2014-09-25T16:07:56  <mdbooth> i.e. I could do a quick scan and expect to see either nothing or +1 in that column. -1 always required attention.
2014-09-25T16:08:11  <mordred> jbooboo: k. I'm off the phone- where can I help?
2014-09-25T16:08:14  <foobio> mdbooth: unfortunately changing a vote in the current versions of gerrit causes a new comment to be created
2014-09-25T16:08:57  <mdbooth> foobio: Hmm. Is that so bad? If that's the price, I'd personally have it back, tbh.
2014-09-25T16:09:02  <mdbooth> Was it causing problems?
2014-09-25T16:10:08  <foobio> mdbooth: we have other systems which provide information on what's currently got jobs running, much more closely coupled to the systems running those jobs

2014-09-25T16:11:45  <foobio> mdbooth: probably better to spend time helping fix the bugs which are resulting in you needing to recheck over and over. that sounds like a really futile existence
2014-09-25T16:12:17  <mdbooth> foobio: Heh, a trivial matter of programming :)
2014-09-25T16:12:22  <mdbooth> Seriously, that's not a quick fix.

2014-09-25T16:13:55  <jbooboo> mordred: are you interested in hacking up the puppet apply test in infra/congfig to add the project-config repo to the zuul cloner (installing it in /etc/project-config) ?
2014-09-25T16:14:06  <foobio> mdbooth: it's like that adage "dress for the job you want, not the job you have." we try to optimize for a working system rather than optimize to make it easier to live with a broken system
2014-09-25T16:14:11  <jbooboo> mordred: (we figured then we can actually include project-config in our puppet integration tests)

2014-09-25T16:15:00  <mdbooth> foobio: That's all very well, but in the mean time it leaves us dressed for the wrong job, with no currently outlook of a career change.

2014-09-25T16:16:06  <mdbooth> Fireman is appropriate :)
2014-09-25T16:16:31  <jbooboo> any objection to making the irc access check job voting?  (not sure why it isn't, actually)
2014-09-25T16:16:34  <mordred> jbooboo: cloner is first-come-first-served, right? so if I want to put in a more specific rule, I put it first and it'll apply more sticky than the general .*/.* ?
2014-09-25T16:16:45  <superbee> jbooboo none here
2014-09-25T16:16:51  <mdbooth> Ok, my 2p anyway. Vote removal made me happy. At least I know it's intentionally gone.

2014-09-25T16:20:40  <jbooboo> foobio, mdbooth: it's _possible_ we could use the gerrit rest api to remove jenkins as a reviewer from a change (thereby silently removing its vote).  we need zuul to start using the rest api, and then add some features to zuul to enable that.
2014-09-25T16:20:52  <jbooboo> though, we should actually test my hypothesis first :)
2014-09-25T16:21:09  <jbooboo> and it's a few days of hacking to actually implement it.  so it's not a short-term thing.

2014-09-25T17:57:43  <sdague> shellshock only impacts if you run bash cgi, right?
2014-09-25T17:57:50  <jbooboo> oops
2014-09-25T17:57:59  *** lttrl has joined #openstack-infra
2014-09-25T17:58:11  <superbee> sdague: sort of. it affects anything that has access to bash. so if you run a terminal box and someone ssh's to it they can pwn themselves
2014-09-25T17:58:21  <sdague> ok
2014-09-25T17:58:31  <superbee> sdague: and python's popen apparently is vulnerable if you cgi that and subprocess to bash
2014-09-25T17:58:36  <jogo> foobio: superbee like gerrit?
2014-09-25T17:58:42  <foobio> sdague: under fairly limited conditions. depends on how your cgi is invoked, what it does with its environment, what interpreter it's using, how it invokes subprocesses, what your default shell is in those circumstances...
2014-09-25T17:58:50  <jbooboo> and ssh with forced commands

2014-09-25T17:59:29  <foobio> right. the forced ssh commands situation is actually a lot more insidious, but it's also something very few sites use
2014-09-25T17:59:35  <superbee> jogo: gerrit runs a java ssh thing without letting you exec bash so gerrit is fine
2014-09-25T17:59:39  <sdague> I was kind of annoyed by the "all the IoT devices are broken with this" ... because mostly those run busybox, so no

2014-09-25T18:03:47  <JayF> CGI is easy to exploit in this case; bash gets run everytime Apache tries to call a CGI

2014-09-25T18:04:00  <JayF> you don't even need vulnerable code in the CGI being run, just the fact you're running a cgi causes you to be vuln

2014-09-25T18:04:31  <JayF> Hmm.
2014-09-25T18:04:44  <superbee> the big issues were if you cgi scripts were bash or subshell to bash then you have problems
2014-09-25T18:05:09  <superbee> mordred: its ok I used the power of ansible to update bash everywhere
2014-09-25T18:05:11  <mordred> wouldn't an exploit during CGI only get you the lower-priv apache user too?
2014-09-25T18:05:11  <anteaya> submitting a new patch to https://review.openstack.org/#/c/123921/ requires a rebase, I am happier to checkout a new config, run my new-improved delete script and use the same change id

2014-09-25T18:05:26  *** dannywilson has quit IRC
2014-09-25T18:05:35  <foobio> JayF: apache doesn't invoke a shell unless you happen to have written your cgi *in* shell script. but your cgi may make system exec calls to run other executables and if it preserves the calling environment and if it's defaulting to bash as that user's shell (or something symlinked to bash) then your goose is cooked

2014-09-25T18:13:43  <jbooboo> arosen1: if we start encoding the current practice into devstack, i think it will conflict with where we are going, and moreover, these are all production systems, which we won't be mananging with devstack
2014-09-25T18:14:05  <foobio> jbooboo: i think probably manual, to give at least one of us a chance to see what puppet actually wants to do. shall disable remove the cron entry on the master?

2014-09-25T18:15:24  <arosen1> jbooboo:  yea i understand that running a production system from devstack isn't the best idea but i think it will at least allow people to see what they need to do to easily configure it.
2014-09-25T18:15:53  <arosen1> also will allow developers to contribe to nodepool more easily
2014-09-25T18:16:14  <foobio> i think for testing out nodepool it might be interesting to install it on a devstack machine you can point it at, if you don't already have an openstack cloud to point it at instead, but meh

2014-09-25T18:22:31  <anteaya> foobio: :D
2014-09-25T18:22:51  <jbooboo> arosen1: i think we may have been talking about _very_ different things.  :)
2014-09-25T18:22:56  <arosen1> :)
2014-09-25T18:23:37  <foobio> arosen1: so if memory serves, you need congress installed from git into the devstack-gate workspace?
2014-09-25T18:23:52  <foobio> er, python-congressclient i guess
2014-09-25T18:24:00  <arosen1> so tempest runs from devstackgate using: tox which creates a venv. If i put python-congressclient in requirements.txt i tries to download it from pip i think?
2014-09-25T18:24:08  <arosen1> foobio: nah different issue we got that one fixed :)
2014-09-25T18:24:36  <foobio> arosen1: so, yes, if you have it in requirements.txt and it's not already installed, it will try to install from pypi
2014-09-25T18:24:36  <mika> any chance that we'll might get a new jenkins-job-builder release? :)

2014-09-25T18:26:52  <mtreinish> arosen1: oh, is the issue that congressclient isn't in the tempest requirements file so it's not getting put in the venv?
2014-09-25T18:27:48  <foobio> arosen1: oh, also it does look like you're doing pip install -U (upgrade) which will try to find and install the newest version of all requirements even if you already have them installed
2014-09-25T18:28:45  <foobio> i'm guessing the full-serial section in tempest's tox.ini specifies to use -U

2014-09-25T18:29:17  <arosen1> foobio:  right there are no git tags and it's not on pypi
2014-09-25T18:29:28  <mtreinish> foobio: yeah it's set on the testenv section: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/tempest/tree/tox.ini#n10
2014-09-25T18:29:38  <arosen1> foobio:  i'm just running the command that devstack-gate runs to run tempest.
2014-09-25T18:30:11  <foobio> arosen1: unrelated note, you may want to go ahead and register it on pypi just so someone else doesn't decide to squat it and force you to rename

2014-09-25T18:32:35  <foobio> jbooboo: yeah, we haven't tweaked install_modules.sh so what you have there is i think all we'll need to test

2014-09-25T18:36:19  <arosen1> foobio:  so is the issue that site_package is not set to true in http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/tempest/tree/tox.ini#n43
2014-09-25T18:36:39  <mtreinish> arosen1: why? you just need to call the test runner on that file (and specify a location for tempest config file with the env variables) and it should work just the same if you run it in that repo vs in tempest's
2014-09-25T18:36:56  <mtreinish> well assuming you adjust the import path for the policy client
2014-09-25T18:37:02  <AJaeger> anteaya: "Job config-compare.xml not defined" in http://logs.openstack.org/03/124103/3/check/gate-config-layout/f831512/console.html

2014-09-25T18:37:52  <arosen1> mtreinish: right i agree. It doesn't matter if i copy it into the tempest project or not if i do that. Though I'll still have the same problem with the python-congressclient
2014-09-25T18:38:57  <foobio> jbooboo: agreed
2014-09-25T18:39:14  <mtreinish> arosen1: well depending on how you run it. The issue is the venv right? why not just setup a post-test hook that directly calls the test runner for the congress tests without using a venv
2014-09-25T18:39:21  <mtreinish> I think barbican has an example of how to do that
2014-09-25T18:39:36  <jbooboo> foobio: done
2014-09-25T18:39:39  <jbooboo> well, approved anyway

2014-09-25T18:41:51  <arosen1> mtreinish: hrm, i kinda wanted to leverage all the goodness of devstack-gate. I think the problem with this is if i want to run additional tests from tempest too things will get more complicated as there'll be 2 results.html.gz files
2014-09-25T18:42:16  <arosen1> or i guess i can just have my own tempest tests output to a different file.
2014-09-25T18:42:31  <mtreinish> arosen1: oh, I assumed this was going to be separate from a full tempest run
2014-09-25T18:42:51  <mika> zaro: beginning of november is freeze, until then the package must be in Debian/testing, so ASAP would be good ;)
2014-09-25T18:43:02  <arosen1> mtreinish: I'd prefer to combine i think this will let me make things more flexable if i want.

2014-09-25T18:58:01  <superbee> jbooboo: are the files different?
2014-09-25T18:58:03  <nibalizer> is the notify passed up from the vcsrepo?
2014-09-25T18:58:11  <superbee> puppet will md5sum them and won't copy if they match
2014-09-25T18:58:39  <jbooboo> basically, there's a process in https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/HTlrATUqXy
2014-09-25T18:58:41  <jbooboo> it starts on line 10
2014-09-25T18:58:42  <foobio> jbooboo: oh, when you said manually apply you meant through puppet, not hand-patched and reloaded. sorry
2014-09-25T18:58:43  <finch> superbee: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/ext/rack/example-passenger-vhost.conf#L12 - our default vhost config doesn't set up a max requests per ruby instance - you might want to set that to some low value and then tune up

I'm having a problem and i wish if any one can help me, when i upgrade to gerrit 2.8.4 jenkins stop working, if i push a commit jenkins don evaluate it, i have the change in queue on zuul waiting for the jenkins vote, do you had this problem when you made this upgrade?, how do you solve it?

2014-09-25T19:27:30  <anteaya> I had tried to cherry pick 124103 then 124116 in a new branch but I can't cherry pick 124116 it erros

2014-09-25T20:14:21  <zaro> Sincler: zuul talks to your gearman server.  so now you should check whether zuul added a job to the gearman queue.
2014-09-25T20:14:32  <jbooboo> yeah, i have a suspicion something is really wrong with those since the move to puppet3

2014-09-25T20:18:03  <foobio> anteaya: "plain" is what cgit changes the url to instead of "tree" if you ask to see the raw file content

2014-09-25T20:33:24  <jesusaurus> jbooboo: in that particular case, it looks like the incorrect 'gerrit_project_file' was use on the right-hand side, so it may have silently resolved to an empty string? its concerning that theres nothing in the log about that

2014-09-25T20:34:44  <jesusaurus> jbooboo: but in general there are a lot of errors in that log, but puppet agent seems to have returned 0, so we may have to use --detailed-exit-codes and manually check each run for a return of 4 or 6 (the possible returns for an error)

2014-09-25T21:21:17  <asselin> is this correct? creates a directory 'layout', or should it be 'file'? https://github.com/openstack-infra/config/blob/master/modules/zuul/manifests/server.pp#L34

2014-09-25T21:59:54  <superbee> and readme problably needs work. anteaya maybe you want to push a new patchset with better readme and we can coauthor the change?
2014-09-25T22:00:03  <superbee> in any case feedback is very welcome
2014-09-25T22:00:53  <jbooboo> i wonder if it might be useful to itemize the directories and what they are for with links to their documentation pages on ci.o.o?
2014-09-25T22:01:18  <superbee> jbooboo: maybe a per dir readme or just at the top level?
2014-09-25T22:01:21  <jbooboo> (just very briefly -- not to duplicate the docs, but just to provide an intro and context)
2014-09-25T22:01:48  <anteaya> jbooboo: looks good, the links all work, the docs look accurate
2014-09-25T22:01:48  <jbooboo> superbee: heh, some of the directories get copied over wholesale; including a readme in them is probably okay but requires thought and double-checking :)
2014-09-25T22:01:59  <superbee> oh right
2014-09-25T22:02:03  <jbooboo> superbee: so i was thinking just at the top level
2014-09-25T22:02:05  <superbee> jbooboo: probably better just at the global level then
2014-09-25T22:02:11  <superbee> I can add that to the readme
2014-09-25T22:02:12  <jbooboo> a link to the stackforge howto might be good too

2014-09-25T22:53:15  <superbee> is the ? redundant and should be replaced with +?
2014-09-25T22:53:41  <anteaya> jbooboo: typo: the bugs it creates.
2014-09-25T22:53:55  <jbooboo> anteaya: what?
2014-09-25T22:54:22  <superbee> oh I think that was a cp we should fix that in a different change

2014-09-25T22:55:55  <asselin> (line 1 & 2)
2014-09-25T22:56:39  <superbee> I am not going to overthink (.*?) that is what we matched in the first glob perviously
2014-09-25T22:56:45  <superbee> and the second part makes sense to me
2014-09-25T22:56:51  <superbee> so pushing as suggested
2014-09-25T22:56:53  <jbooboo> superbee: current is "shortest string of anything up to a /".  it doesn't need to be the shortest since we only expect one /.  i think the alt would be (.+)/  i think either will work.
2014-09-25T22:57:17  <jbooboo> anteaya: oops.  oh well.  :)
2014-09-25T22:57:24  <superbee> jbooboo: ya (.+)/ is how my brain works. do you have a preference?

2014-09-25T23:48:26  <jbooboo> foobio: yeah, i think we're about ready for that.  when you're done reviewing the email, i'll send it, then i think we can aprv the remove files in config change

2014-09-25T23:48:41  <jbooboo> foobio: yep
2014-09-25T23:48:58  <jbooboo> foobio: then i'd say we're set to -2 related changes.  maybe keep a list of those and we can abandon them after a couple of weeks?
2014-09-25T23:49:24  <jbooboo> (this seems like a good use of abandon to me)
2014-09-25T23:49:30  <foobio> will totally add a running list of the change ids in the etherpad

2014-09-25T23:51:17  <Sukhdev> Folks, I am hitting failure in jenkins -  http://logs.openstack.org/86/123886/2/check/check-tempest-dsvm-neutron-heat-slow/5f86a11/console.html
2014-09-25T23:51:26  *** gokrokve has quit IRC
2014-09-25T23:51:43  <Sukhdev> I rechecked to kick off another jenkins run and now I get this failure https://jenkins05.openstack.org/job/check-tempest-dsvm-neutron-heat-slow/16693/console
2014-09-25T23:52:07  <foobio> jbooboo: just finished proofing, lgtm, no edits, send it asap, kthxbai
2014-09-25T23:52:15  <jbooboo> Sukhdev: those don't look like test infrastructure failures to me
2014-09-25T23:52:22  <jbooboo> Sukhdev: you might try asking in the #openstack-qa channel
2014-09-25T23:52:22  <Sukhdev> Is this known issue? anything I can do to get past this issue?
2014-09-25T23:52:42  <Sukhdev> jbooboo: I did - no body responded
2014-09-25T23:53:11  <Sukhdev> jbooboo: I usually get better luck with these kinds of issues - hence, thought I ask in both channels
2014-09-25T23:53:17  <anteaya> Sukhdev: or a neutron issue
2014-09-25T23:53:33  <jbooboo> Sukhdev: it's near or past the end of day in US, you could wait or try again at a different time
2014-09-25T23:53:37  <anteaya> BadRequest: Security group default already exists for project
