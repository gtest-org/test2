2015-01-07T17:48:19  <jbooboo> mordred: nifty.  i imagine you would expect a bit of code to be removed from nodepool, etc, in that process?
2015-01-07T17:49:04  <dhellmann> is paste.openstack.org down? I'm seeing internal server errors.
2015-01-07T17:49:05  <mordred> jbooboo: yes. I would ultimately imagine that there are no direct calls to python-*client in nodepool and that any fancy logic we have to deal with what should be very normal operations would be in shade for ease of reuse by mortals

2015-01-07T18:27:53  <Krinkle> I understand OpenStack runs their Jenkins jobs in VMs, is that correct? I'd like to know a little about how you guys are doing this at the moment.

2015-01-07T18:28:39  <foobio> Krinkle: we have a service called nodepool which creates virtual machine instances in openstack providers and adds them to jenkins as slaves

2015-01-07T18:29:38  <Krinkle> foobio: Right, so it maintains a pool of hot standby nodes before a Jenkins build is triggered, right? and it's disposed of after wards?
2015-01-07T18:29:44  <mordred> that's right
2015-01-07T18:29:48  <Krinkle> Are the nodes part of an openstack cluster?
2015-01-07T18:29:49  <foobio> Krinkle: what specifically do you need to know about them? they each get the jenkins slave agent installed into the virtual machine instance and then the jenkins master connects via ssh and instructs the slave agent to run whatever job
2015-01-07T18:29:53  *** mbacchi has joined #openstack-infra

2015-01-07T18:30:29  <foobio> Krinkle: we have a tenant account in rackspace and one in hpcloud and nodepool launches virtual machine instances in both
2015-01-07T18:30:31  <Krinkle> Currently we have about a dozen slaves in our OpenStack cloud but those slaves are manually set up in our cloud and persisent.

2015-01-07T18:31:23  <Krinkle> but this nodepool software would automate the creation of nodes?
2015-01-07T18:31:26  <foobio> also it makes it really easy to wipe clean if something does go awry

2015-01-07T18:35:10  <Krinkle> mordred: foobio: What kind of features does it have in terms of provisioning? Do you provision them in the base image and upload that manually? Or could they be provisioned with e.g. puppet ahead of time?
2015-01-07T18:36:02  <Krinkle> Ideally we wouldn't have to create images all the time and replace them in the openstack backend. Our cloud is public and these would be kind of internal images that (contrary to our base images like those for ubuntu-trusty) are changing a lot.
2015-01-07T18:36:09  *** rfolco_ has quit IRC
2015-01-07T18:36:18  *** Ala has quit IRC
2015-01-07T18:36:41  <mordred> Krinkle: so - there's two answers to that
2015-01-07T18:37:07  <mordred> Krinkle: one of the main things that nodepool does right now is create tenant-local base images for your tests based on existing images in the cloud
2015-01-07T18:37:13  <mordred> Krinkle: and it'll refresh them regularly
2015-01-07T18:37:30  <Krinkle> it'd be slower to create an image from the general image and provision with puppet, but it'd have the advantage of being able to change them by only comitting to puppet and updating the cloud's main puppetmaster.
2015-01-07T18:37:32  <mordred> Krinkle: so if your cloud has a base ubuntu-trusty image, you can configure nodepool to use that to make the base image it needs for the nodes
2015-01-07T18:37:37  *** rfolco_ has joined #openstack-infra
2015-01-07T18:37:46  <mordred> we do that to pre-cache things in our base images and whatnot
2015-01-07T18:37:46  <Krinkle> mordred: cool
2015-01-07T18:37:52  <Krinkle> Yeah
2015-01-07T18:38:09  <mordred> I'm _currently_ working on an update to that to use diskimage-builder locally to make teh base images and upload them via glance api
2015-01-07T18:38:19  <Krinkle> mordred: what do you mean by refresh regularly? Does it re-use existing instances?
2015-01-07T18:38:43  <mordred> no - it'll start from the base ubuntu-trusty image and run a set of scripts (in our case puppet) to specialize the image and then snapshot it
2015-01-07T18:38:51  *** cp16net has quit IRC
2015-01-07T18:38:53  <Krinkle> perfect
2015-01-07T18:38:53  <mordred> then we re-do that daily to pick up updates
2015-01-07T18:39:00  <mordred> but it's all automated and stuff
2015-01-07T18:39:02  <Krinkle> and then use that snapshot for the next instance to be created in the pool.
2015-01-07T18:39:03  *** cp16net has joined #openstack-infra
2015-01-07T18:39:04  <mordred> yes
2015-01-07T18:39:11  <mordred> we create all the instances from teh snapshots
2015-01-07T18:39:15  <Krinkle> Yeah
2015-01-07T18:39:42  <mordred> so we try to do the expensive things in the image prep steps - like pre-fetching all of the git repos we might need - that way a test only has to pull a few refs from git rather than a full clone
2015-01-07T18:39:43  <Krinkle> Is it alright if I save mordred, foobio and my lines in a public log?

2015-01-07T19:00:41  <mordred> Krinkle: well, the main issue we ran in to is that the logic of what we're wanting to do is here actualy a bit counter to the internal data model in jenkins
2015-01-07T19:01:33  <mordred> Krinkle: the jenkins scheduler looks at the resources it has available and makes decisions on what run and what to queue based on that
2015-01-07T19:02:02  *** armax has quit IRC
2015-01-07T19:02:44  <mordred> so then in the other cloud launchers and the jclouds launcher, there's essentially a virtual node provider which is "always" available for scheduling, but then the interaction with either node creation or pulling something from a pool happens at the time of job request

2015-01-07T19:03:21  <mordred> by keeping it as an external pool that uses the jenkins API and subscribes to jenkins notification events, nothing strange has to be done from the jenkins perspective wrt scheduling of work

2015-01-07T19:03:38  *** emagana has quit IRC
2015-01-07T19:03:52  <mordred> if there is a slave attached with an ubuntu label and a job that wants to run on it, jenkins does the right thing. if, for whatever reason, there is not, jenkins also does the right thing
2015-01-07T19:03:57  <Krinkle> mordred: And I suppose creation of instances to be hot standys in a pool, wouldn't be possible in jclouds model?
2015-01-07T19:04:31  <mordred> well, it could be - but you'd be doing it all essentially inside of a daemon thread inside of jenkins - so the model would be similar other than you'd be colocated in the same process space
2015-01-07T19:05:17  <Krinkle> mordred: I suspect we wont have many different types of nodes, but we do have more than one (at the moment mostly Precise vs Trusty). Would nodepool also be able to create instances from snapshots based on the node labels for the pending jobs in the queue?
2015-01-07T19:05:36  *** subscope has joined #openstack-infra
2015-01-07T19:06:02  <mordred> yes - we have a few different kinds of nodes as well - and each of those node types carry their own quota and min-ready config values
2015-01-07T19:06:23  <mordred> so we can tune how many of what to keep ready based on patterns we see over time

2015-01-07T19:25:02  <comstud> which means snapshots and stuff would not work

2015-01-07T19:32:33  <comstud> quantumfly: I think... they actually build them under xenserver and snap them

2015-01-07T19:36:15  <mordred> it does vmdk

2015-01-07T19:37:05  <comstud> I think it generates fixed type vhds only maybe.

2015-01-07T20:10:10  <quantumfly> so wouldn't help the current users of 76057
2015-01-07T20:10:45  <jbooboo> quantumfly: that and alternative change 132591 both deal with the 'ref-replicated' log spam that i suspect we would start getting with 2.9.
2015-01-07T20:11:27  <jbooboo> quantumfly: no, but i'm thinking that 135332 as a further evolution of 76057 might be slick.
2015-01-07T20:11:59  <quantumfly> yup would make that code more deterministic

2015-01-07T21:01:25  <radez> stevemar: and I have a bunch of new hardware on order for TryStack that we will put Kilo on.
2015-01-07T21:01:42  <mordred> radez: no worries - it's just that I've literally NEVER gotten vagrant to operate, so I was pretty sure that if you were waiting on vagrant anything from me I was in trouble

2015-01-07T21:02:05  <patrickeast> foobio: gotcha. mines created an image but hasn’t spun up a node yet to attach as a slave, i was thinking it did that only once zuul got triggered by something… but now that I think about it i’m not sure where i got that idea… thanks for the info, guess i’ll go dig around my nodepool logs and see what happened
2015-01-07T21:02:44  <radez> stevemar: I guess at athis point I'll just circle back to you when I have a kilo install and an openstackid.org development env and we can hack on it
2015-01-07T21:02:50  <mrmartin> mordred: operate vagrant is not a rocket science
2015-01-07T21:03:12  <stevemar> radez, yeah i think so, what do you imagine is the ETA of that?
2015-01-07T21:03:13  <radez> mrmartin: I've acually taught a class on it but not ever used it for anything in particular :)

2015-01-07T21:03:50  <mordred> mrmartin: but I'm really not kidding, I have tried several times and have never not once not one single time ever been able to run any of its commands without getting errors
2015-01-07T21:04:00  <mordred> mrmartin: I recognize it works well for people who are not me

2015-01-07T21:06:13  <foobio> asselin: yes, though possibly only the next time a new worker is added capable of running that job. we've seen some odd/racy behavior around that which i'm unclear whether is resolved

2015-01-07T21:06:36  <mordred> mrmartin: yup. I hear that. as a solid ubuntu user though I can tell you last time I tried to play I couldn't even get a working copy installed using the instructions on their main website
2015-01-07T21:06:54  <mordred> mrmartin: because teh version of vagrant in ubuntu is too old to know about the changes in the vargant repo format
2015-01-07T21:06:59  <asselin> foobio, ok good info. thank you
2015-01-07T21:07:02  <mordred> but the version on their website was not installable
2015-01-07T21:07:06  <mordred> so I once again gave up
2015-01-07T21:07:18  <mordred> largely because I think their version of "easy" and mine just don't mesh
2015-01-07T21:07:24  <mrmartin> :)
2015-01-07T21:07:46  <mordred> then again - I think that OSX makes EVERYTHING a billion times harder than linux
2015-01-07T21:07:47  <foobio> asselin: we churn replacement of nodes through our jenkins masters rapidly enough that at least one of the 7 general masters ends up registering pretty quickly if that race is still happening
2015-01-07T21:07:49  <radez> stevemar: RDO should start to package at k2, trystack runs on the RDO packages so once those start to land I'll get a test stsem up and running and move forward from there

2015-01-07T21:08:56  <asselin> foobio,  yes, hense why 3rd party ppl seem to get that more often. it would be good to somehow retrigger it when jobs are updated via e.g. jenkisn job builder

2015-01-07T21:09:03  *** thingee has joined #openstack-infra
2015-01-07T21:09:10  <mordred> so "vagrant pull ubuntu" or whatever the command is doesn't work
2015-01-07T21:09:45  <foobio> asselin: it would have to be solved in the jenkins-gearman plugin if so
2015-01-07T21:09:55  <mrmartin> once I'll have time I want to try out vagrant + docker

2015-01-07T21:16:51  <alexpilotti> quantumfly: yes, we also contributed some code to qemu-img for VHDX
2015-01-07T21:16:57  <patrickeast> asselin: ooh, good idea… just checked and mines 0.0.7, i assume its safe to update to the latest?
2015-01-07T21:17:06  <quantumfly> alexpilotti: what image type do you use as the output and do you start with raw as the source?
2015-01-07T21:17:50  <alexpilotti> quantumfly: no we start directly with VHD or VHDX and convert to QCow2 or VMDK at the end
2015-01-07T21:18:06  <quantumfly> :/
2015-01-07T21:18:29  <quantumfly> maybe the fix is to make dib mount a vhd?
2015-01-07T21:18:36  <quantumfly> mordred: ^ I have no idea what that would look like though
2015-01-07T21:19:23  <mordred> well, to mount a vhd don't we need xenserver or hyperv?

2015-01-07T22:02:04  <foobio> the ! is there to make a sudo -n true failure acceptable and a sudo -n true success unacceptable

2015-01-07T22:13:26  <jbooboo> and it's also equivalent to the reported value for console.txt

2015-01-07T23:47:55  <foobio> katherine: er, in this case since /p/ is a scriptalias to the git cgi, in actuality there should be a "fusion" subdirectory appearing beneath whatever your GIT_PROJECT_ROOT envvar is being set to
2015-01-07T23:49:06  <katherine> foobio: there is a fusion.git under the GIT_PROJECT_ROOT:  /home/gerrit/review_site/git, which is where the /p/ is mapped to
